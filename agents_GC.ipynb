    "## Target Information\n",
    "- **Given target:** Neurokinin 3 receptor\n",
    "- **Given disease:** vasomotor symptoms due to menopause\n",
    "- **Given mode of action:** Antagonism of the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) GPCR\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "Preclinical research has strongly implicated heightened signalling of neurokinin B together with its receptor (neurokinin 3 receptor [NK3R]) in causing menopausal vasomotor symptoms, via the hypothalamic median pre-optic nucleus and autonomic thermoregulatory pathway. \n",
    "Subsequent phase 2b trials of NK3R antagonists showed that pharmacological blockade of NK3R attenuated vasomotor symptoms almost as effectively as hormone treatment, without the need for oestrogen exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Develop a Scientific Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a scientific rationale for Neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) GPCR in Vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highlight the working hypothesis for the clinical target rationale and human biology evidence by minimum 2000 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe as much as possible the evidence in humans or in human tissue that link the target, target space or approach to the pathogenesis of interest. If known, also describe here the wanted mode of action with regards to desired clinical outcome. Please avoid including only pre-clinical data in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working Hypothesis\n",
    "- Create a detailed description of the following idea: Develop an inhibitor of the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) GPCR for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.\n",
    "- Is there a significant unmet medical need?\n",
    "- Is it suitable for combination therapy?\n",
    "- Which predictive biomarkers exist for the target related to the disease?\n",
    "  - Provide a detailed description of existing clinically relevant biomarkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clinical Target Rationale\n",
    "- How relevant is the target location to the disease biology?\n",
    "- How is the target expression altered in human disease?\n",
    "- How is the target involved in the physiological process relevant to the disease?\n",
    "- Which phenotypes and genotypes were identified for the target?\n",
    "- How is the genetic link between the target and the disease?\n",
    "- Describe the evidence provided in clinics or by tools acting on the pathway where the target is involved.\n",
    "- Which kind of target modulation is required to treat the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges for the Drug Discovery Program\n",
    "- Check the following idea for details on small molecule compounds: Develop an inhibitor of the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) GPCR for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.\n",
    "- Is an 'information driven approach' (IDA) strategy based on available small molecules possible?\n",
    "  - Which small molecular modulators of the target are known?\n",
    "  - Which inhibitors, antagonists, agonists, negative allosteric modulators (NAM), positive allosteric modulators (PAM) are required for target modulation in the given disease? \n",
    "- Which patients would respond to the therapy?\n",
    "- Is the proposed mode of action on the target desirable and commercially viable in a clinical setting?\n",
    "- What are advantages and disadvantages of different therapeutic modalities (antibodies, small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, PROTACs, molecular glue, peptide macrocycles, and so on) for tackling the target?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative Indications\n",
    "- Describe alternative indications for modulators of the target and explain why.\n",
