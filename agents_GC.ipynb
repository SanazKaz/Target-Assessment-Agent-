Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is effective at alleviating menopausal symptoms, but some women cannot or prefer not to take HRT. Since current non-hormonal options have suboptimal efficacy/tolerability, there is a pressing need for an effective, well-tolerated alternative. The neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) has recently been implicated in the generation of menopausal HFs and represents a novel therapeutic target to ameliorate HF symptoms. This review aims to assess if NK3R antagonists (NK3Ras) are more effective than Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)\\u2014currently a common choice for non-hormonal treatment of menopausal HFs. Studies were identified after systematically searching Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE databases based on PRISMA guidelines. Trial quality and bias were assessed. Key efficacy outcomes (HF frequency, HF severity and number of night-time awakenings/night-sweats) and selected safety outcomes were extracted and analysed. Seven SNRI and four NK3Ra placebo-controlled randomised trials (plus four follow-up reports) were included in this review. NK3Ra administration resulted in a larger reduction from baseline in HF frequency, HF severity and night-sweats compared to SNRIs. Five of seven SNRI trials showed a reduction in HF frequency that was statistically significant (by 48\\u201367% from baseline at weeks 8 or 12) whereas all NK3Ra trials showed a statistically significant reduction in HF frequency (by 62\\u201393% from baseline at weeks 2, 4 or 12). While SNRI trials reported poor tolerability, particularly nausea, NK3Ra trials reported good tolerability overall, although two trials reported elevation in transaminases. NK3Ras trials show encouraging efficacy and tolerability/safety. Completion of phase 3 NK3Ra trials are required to confirm efficacy and uphold safety/tolerability data but phase 2 results suggest that NK3Ras are more effective than SNRIs for non-hormonal treatment of menopausal HFs.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nBetween 45 and 97% of menopausal women suffer vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes/flashes and night-sweats) which can significantly impact their quality of life and 10\\u201320% find them almost intolerable.Conventional treatment is hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but some women cannot or prefer not to take HRT. However, current non-hormonal options have suboptimal efficacy and tolerability.Neurokinin B, predominantly acting via the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R), has been implicated in the generation of menopausal hot flushes/flashes.We undertook a systematic qualitative review to compare outcomes of placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials using neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists (NK3Ras) with those using Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) for the non-hormonal treatment of menopausal hot flushes/flashes.NK3Ra trials reported numerically superior efficacy and better safety/tolerability compared with SNRIs trials. Provided that phase 3 NK3Ra trials are supportive, NK3Ras appear a promising therapy for this challenging area. Hot flushes/flashes (HFs), defined as transient sensations of heat, flushing, sweating and chills, affect between 45 and 97% of women during menopause and can significantly degrade their quality of life [1]. HFs often lead to sleep disturbances for a prolonged period, with recurrent episodes occurring over a median duration of 7.4\\u00a0years [2]. Between 10 and 20% of women find HFs almost intolerable [3]. While the full pathophysiological mechanism of HFs remains elusive, oestrogen deficiency appears to play a causative role.

In a recent study, Lederman and colleagues1 reported the safety and efficacy of fezolinetant for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nThe neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) antagonists belong to a new class of drugs initially developed in the 80s for the treatment of schizophrenia, an indication that was subsequently abandoned. They were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on May 12, 2023 and are now under regulatory review in the Europe, and Australia for the primary indication of treatment of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of menopause.2 During the menopause transition and in the years following menopause, VMS (hot flushes) affect about 80% of women, and for some, they can be extremely bothersome, of long duration, and can negatively impact quality of life. These symptoms are attributed to a narrowing of the hypothalamic thermoneutral zone triggered by altered control mechanisms in the setting of declining estrogen levels. This results in activation of VMS by smaller elevations in core body temperature than premenopausally. A central nervous system network of kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy) neurons, shown by Rance et\\u00a0al. to be located within the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus, activates the NK3R.3 They also demonstrated that KNDy neurons were involved in regulating body temperature. In postmortem studies of postmenopausal women, with marked reduction of endogenous estradiol, hypertrophy of KNDy neurons, and a dramatic increase in neurokinin B gene expression were observed.3 Of the NK3R antagonists that were initially evaluated to alleviate VMS in postmenopausal women, few remain in clinical development because of side effects. Of those compounds currently being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials, fezolinetant is the first to be considered for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration.4 Published March 13, 2023 in the Lancet online, a 12-week, phase 3 randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial called SKYLIGHT 1, with a 40-week active treatment safety extension, provides additional evidence regarding the efficacy and\\u00a0safety of fezolinetant for treatment of VMS.1 Fezolinetant was administered at\\u00a0doses of 30\\u00a0mg/day and 45\\u00a0mg/day.

      "        \"original_text\": \",72\\u201374] This review attends to the increasing demand for efficacious and novel treatment that can function as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy. We collate all primary clinical studies from the growing body of evidence that implicates the NKB and NK3R signaling pathway focusing on the pathophysiology of menopausal women presenting with vasomotor symptoms. The recent years have also been a testament to NK3R antagonism pathways that can serve as a viable alternative to the current gold standard of hormone replacement therapy among menopausal women.[49,75\\u201377] NK3 receptor antagonists\\u2013MLE4901 were first tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 2017 among women aged 40 to 62.[31] Prague et al[31] randomized controlled trial, MLE4901 led to a reduction of 45% in hot flush frequency. The women demonstrated a 72% reduction in the frequency of hot flashes. NK3R antagonists have also led to large improvements in the severity, bother interference, and frequency of hot flushes on day 3 by Prague and colleagues in 2018,[47] and on day 2 by Skorupskaite et al in 2018.[48] Prague et al[31] also reported that the benefits were sustained over 4 weeks. One caveat includes the gastrointestinal disturbance and headaches that were reported across the included trials to a mild and moderate extent. Prague et al[46] in 2019 showed that MLE4901 did not address estradiol or FSH levels in postmenopausal women, therefore reducing some serious adverse events in women when compared to hormone replacement therapy. These findings were replicated by Depypere et al[45] in 2019 where the hot flushing frequency was reduced by 93% and the severity was reduced by 70%. Notably, the quality of life conditions including the quality of sleep, daily interference, and functional impairment also improved among women.[45] MLE4901 was emphasized with a rapid onset of action and no changes to estradiol.[45] Moreover, Fraser and colleagues, in 2020, reported that the intervention did not lead to any changes in endometrial lining thickness and did not lead to endometrial hyperplasia; both being independent risk factors for endometrial cancer.[42] This further shed light on the notion that NK3R antagonists either alone or in combination with NK1R antagonists can be a preferable treatment option among women contraindicated to estrogen therapy to manage VMS. NT814, an oral NK3R, and NK1R antagonist have depicted evidence of crossing the blood-brain barrier and has achieved long-lasting occupancy at the receptor site documented through positron emission tomography data in healthy male volunteers.[78] NK1R site occupancy has also been extrapolated based on in vitro affinity ratios.[49,50,79] The postulation of NT-814 dosage required to occupy 95% of all NK1 receptors is for an occupation of nearly 67% of all NK3 receptors; this can antagonize NKB and NK3R central signaling.[62,80] The data provides insights into the potential hypothalamic effects of peripheral administration of NK3R antagonists to counteract heat dissipation responses seen among women experiencing hot flushes.[81\\u201385] Clinically, NT-814 can reduce nighttime awakenings among women by 81% as reported by Trower et al in their \",\n",

Thus, there remains a considerable need for a safe, highly effective, nonhormone therapy for relief of VMS associated with menopause. Neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R) antagonism is a novel, nonhormone approach to treating VMS that directly targets the underlying central mechanism thought to be responsible for this medical condition. A subset of hypothalamic neurons that co-express the neuropeptides kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy neurons) project from the arcuate nucleus to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and are believed to play a key role in thermoregulation.19-21 These neurons are inhibited by estrogen and stimulated by NK3R activation.22-26 With declining estrogen levels in menopause, NK3R-mediated signaling is unopposed and hypertrophy of KNDy neurons is observed with anticipated, commensurate changes in the activity of the brain regions that these neurons innervate.27-29 The altered activity of this neural circuit results in the thermoregulatory centre becoming hypersensitive to external cues from peripheral sensors, activating heat dissipation effectors (eg, sweating, vasodilation), and is believed to be the physiologic basis for why many menopausal women experience VMS.20-22 Fezolinetant, an oral NK3R antagonist that moderates KNDy neuronal activity,30,31 is in clinical development for the treatment of moderate/severe VMS associated with menopause.

Consequently, menstruation ceases, fertility is lost, and in most women a cluster of symptoms become prominent, which impact physical, psychosocial, sexual, and overall wellbeing. Symptoms can be long lasting (median 7\\u00b74 years),1 and most women report that vasomotor symptoms (termed hot flushes or flashes or night sweats) are the most bothersome of all,2 with at least 10% of women reporting them as intolerable.3 An effective treatment is hormone replacement therapy as this artificially restores circulating oestrogen. However, hormone replacement therapy and in particular combined hormone replacement therapy is not without risk, and is contraindicated in many women due to the long-term safety concerns, including an increased risk of breast4 and ovarian5 cancers, thromboembolism,4 and stroke.4 Other treatments including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,6 gabapentin,6 tibolone,6 and cognitive behavioural therapy7 have been shown to have some efficacy but can cause side-effects. Herbal remedies, such as black cohosh and red clover might provide some relief but efficacy is variable between trials.8 It is estimated that a novel treatment for menopausal flushes could currently benefit 10 million women in the UK alone,9 and therefore a better understanding of the aetiology of such flushes and an associated targeted therapeutic is required.

Hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment but is contraindicated in some women, and is not without risk in all due to long-term safety concerns, particularly an increased risk of breast cancer (though perhaps less so if it is oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy), thromboembolism, and stroke. Alternative treatments\\u2014eg, some antidepressants and herbal remedies, have been shown to have some efficacy but not always greater than the effect of a placebo depending on the study and treatment class, and are not without side-effects too. For the past 20 years a growing body of evidence has accumulated that implicates neurokinin B (NKB) signalling (a hypothalamic neuropeptide) together with its receptor (NK3R) in the aetiology of menopausal hot flushes.

The authors reported that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone/LH pulsatile and association with vasomotor symptoms had the potential as a therapeutic approach for women. Nine randomized controlled trials were assessed for risk of bias using RoB2. Overall, some concerns were present for bias arising during the randomization process for Prague (2017), whereas all other studies had low concerns. Concerning biases arising due to deviations from the intended interventions, Trower (2020) presented with some concerns whereas all other trials had low concerns. On noting biases arising due to missing outcome data and in the measurement of the outcome, Prague (2019) and Prague (2017) had some concerns while all other trials had low concerns. Bias in the selection of the reported result was seen with Fraser (2020) and Prague (2019) while all other trials had low concerns. Overall, 2 studies (Prague, 2019; Prague, 2017) had some concerns about the risk of bias while all other trials had low concerns (Fig. 2). Risk of bias study-by-study and summary findings across the included trials. We reviewed pharmacologic agents including fezolinetant (ESN364) and pavinetant (MLE4901); both are antagonists of NK3R.[49\\u201354] Moreover, we also studied NT-814, which is an NK1R and NK3R dual antagonist.[49] It is proposed that the lowering of estrogen levels among women undergoing menopause is the key cause of VMS.[55\\u201358] However, the exact origin of the mechanism behind the altering estrogen levels is currently unclear. The NKB signaling pathway was recently implicated in the development of VMS, and the past 5 years have led to trickling data toward the potential of the pharmacological agents in modulating NKB activity and improving menopausal symptoms.[10,59\\u201363] Animal and human studies suggest that the NK3 receptor signaling induces hot flushes, which has been a core area of research with trials aiming to elicit the signaling pathway as a potential target in improving the quality of life among women.[64\\u201367] In our review, we find that without the disruption of the estrogen levels among menopausal and post-menopausal women, hot flush symptoms could be controlled. However, common modalities of treatment of symptomatology comprise hormone replacement therapy with either progestogen and estrogen together or estrogen alone. While hormone replacement is efficacious and considered generally safe for women in the short term, longer use for 5 years or more is associated with increased thromboembolic disorders and bone fractures.[68\\u201371] Therefore, there has been a cautionary recommendation associated with the long-term use of hormone replacement; women at risk of cardiovascular disease or malignancies including endometrial or breast have limited therapy options.[68,72\\u201374] This review attends to the increasing demand for efficacious and novel treatment that can function as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy.

Scientific research has changed our understanding of HF etiology over the last 20 years with two critical findings. The first was the role of specialized hypothalamic neurons that colocalize kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin receptors (KNDy neurons) across the reproductive lifespan9; and the second was the work of Rance and colleagues who have elucidated the neurocircuitry of hypothalamic NKB signaling together with its receptor, the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R), in the thermoregulatory autonomic system in response to estrogen deficiency.10-15 Two recent publications further implicate NKB/NK3R signaling in menopausal flushing: (1) peripheral administration of NKB in premenopausal women resulted in HFs that were typical of those described by postmenopausal women,16 and (2) a population-based study suggested genetic variation in TACR3, the gene that encodes NK3R could be associated with the variability in vasomotor symptoms experienced by postmenopausal women.17 Collectively, the prior literature led us to hypothesize that NKB/NK3R signaling is critical in menopausal flushing. We therefore carried out a study to determine whether vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women could be attenuated by administration of an oral NK3R antagonist. This trial completed earlier this year and confirmed that an NK3R antagonist can reduce HFs in postmenopausal women after 4 weeks of treatment.18 In this article we report novel data from that study, which shows the detailed time course of this effect.

      "### Scientific Rationale for Neurokinin 3 Receptor (NK3R) in Vasomotor Symptoms Due to Menopause\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The working hypothesis for this investigation is that the development of an inhibitor of the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) GPCR can effectively treat vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. These symptoms, which include hot flashes and night sweats, are prevalent in a significant portion of menopausal women, with estimates suggesting that between 45% and 97% experience these symptoms to varying degrees of severity. The unmet medical need is substantial, as many women either cannot or prefer not to use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) due to associated risks, including increased cancer risk and adverse cardiovascular events.\n",
      "\n",
      "NK3R antagonists, such as fezolinetant, have emerged as promising alternatives, demonstrating efficacy comparable to traditional therapies while avoiding estrogen exposure. Given the physiological role of NK3R in thermoregulation, particularly through the modulation of KNDy neurons in the hypothalamus, targeting this receptor presents a novel therapeutic approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for NK3R-related therapies include neurokinin B levels and genetic variations in the TACR3 gene, which encodes the NK3 receptor. These biomarkers may help identify patients who are more likely to respond to NK3R antagonism.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Clinical Target Rationale\n",
      "\n",
      "The NK3R is highly relevant to the pathophysiology of menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Research has shown that neurokinin B signaling, which activates NK3R, is implicated in the thermoregulatory dysfunction observed during menopause. Specifically, estrogen deficiency leads to the hypertrophy of KNDy neurons, resulting in increased sensitivity to thermal stimuli and subsequent vasomotor symptoms. Clinical studies have demonstrated that NK3R antagonists significantly reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes, with reductions reported as high as 93% in some trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alterations in NK3R expression have been documented in postmenopausal women, with increased neurokinin B levels correlating with symptom severity. Genetic studies have also linked variations in the TACR3 gene to the variability in vasomotor symptoms experienced by women, further establishing the genetic connection between NK3R and menopausal symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy of NK3R antagonists. For instance, fezolinetant has been shown to reduce vasomotor symptoms significantly, with a high percentage of participants achieving a 50% reduction in symptoms. The safety profile of NK3R antagonists appears favorable, with fewer adverse effects compared to traditional HRT and SNRIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Challenges for the Drug Discovery Program\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing an NK3R antagonist for menopausal vasomotor symptoms presents several challenges. While there are existing small molecule compounds targeting NK3R, the development of a safe and effective therapy requires a thorough understanding of the receptor's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. An information-driven approach (IDA) strategy could be beneficial, leveraging existing data on small molecular modulators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Known NK3R antagonists, such as fezolinetant and MLE4901, have shown promise in clinical trials, but further research is needed to optimize dosing regimens and minimize potential side effects. Identifying patient populations that would respond favorably to NK3R antagonism is crucial for successful clinical outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed mode of action—blocking NK3R to alleviate vasomotor symptoms—appears commercially viable, especially given the growing demand for non-hormonal treatment options. However, the advantages and disadvantages of various therapeutic modalities must be considered, including the potential for combination therapies with other non-hormonal agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Alternative Indications\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond menopausal vasomotor symptoms, NK3R antagonists may have potential applications in other indications, such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and certain anxiety disorders. The role of neurokinin B signaling in mood regulation suggests that NK3R antagonism could provide therapeutic benefits in these areas as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientific rationale for targeting the neurokinin 3 receptor in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause is robust, supported by a growing body of clinical evidence. The development of NK3R antagonists represents a promising avenue for addressing the significant unmet medical need for effective, non-hormonal therapies in this population. Continued research and clinical trials will be essential to confirm the efficacy and safety of these agents and to explore their potential in alternative indications.\n",
