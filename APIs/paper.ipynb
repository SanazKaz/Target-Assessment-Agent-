In this review, we discuss evidence to date that suggests how a D1 and D5 dopamine receptor–selective (D1-like) partial agonist may have a distinct clinical efficacy and safety profile compared with that of currently approved D2- and D3-selective (D2-like) DAs. The basal ganglia of the brain are modeled with two functional circuits (direct and indirect pathways) that help translate cortical inputs into specific “go” (facilitation) and “stop” (suppression) signals from the thalamus to the broader motor system [29], [30]. This model posits that the go and stop signals are propagated through direct and indirect pathways, respectively, which project to the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), the primary output of basal ganglia [30]. GPi output exerts an inhibitory effect on thalamocortical neurons that promote movement [29]. Dopamine facilitates movement by stimulating the direct (go) pathway and inhibiting the indirect (stop) pathway [31]. Dopaminergic activation of direct pathway medium spiny neurons inhibits the GPi by releasing GABA, thereby promoting movement, whereas activation of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons inhibits GPi indirectly via the globus pallidus externa and subthalamic nucleus to promote movement [29], [32]. Ultimately, integration between the direct and indirect pathways produces coordinated motor output and fine temporal patterning of neural activity [29]. Of note, while all dopamine receptors are expressed in striatum, D1 receptors and D2 receptors are most abundantly expressed on striatal neurons [33]. Striatal D1 and D2 receptors are localized to distinct neuronal populations, with D1 receptors expressed on direct pathway neurons and D2 receptors expressed in the indirect pathway [26]. Specific or differential functional involvement of D3, D4, and D5 receptors in the striatal motor circuitry is less known, particularly due to relatively lower expression and nonselectivity of available tools [33], [34]. Most approved DAs primarily target D2/D3 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [21], [22], [24], [25]. Bromocriptine, one of the major earlier generation ergot-derived DAs, primarily activates D2/D3/D4 receptors [17], [35], [36]. Among other major ergoline DAs, pergolide activates D2/D3/D4 receptors but may also have some affinity for D1/D5 receptors [17], [24], [37], [38], [39]. Second-generation, nonergoline DAs (Table 1) such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, also primarily activate D2/D3/D4 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [17], [23], [24], [40]. Apomorphine has been proposed to act as a less-specific DA that activates all dopamine receptor subtypes, including D1/D5 receptors, although its affinity for D1 receptors is reported to be lower than that for other dopamine receptor subtypes [21], [22], [23]. However, apomorphine’s affinity for D1/D5 receptors is still considerably higher compared to other D2/D3 DAs such as pramipexole and ropinirole [24]. Among\n",

This approach has been driven by observations that people with early-stage PD treated with D2/D3 DAs have reduced incidence of motor complications (e.g., wearing-OFF phenomena, dyskinesias) [89], [90]. Still, the relatively small treatment difference in dyskinesia combined with the overall superior efficacy of levodopa suggests that delaying treatment with levodopa in favor of D2/D3 DAs in early PD may not provide substantial long-term benefits [87]. Novel approaches that balance risk of motor (e.g., dyskinesias) versus nonmotor (e.g., ICDs, hallucinations) AEs across disease stages are needed. Limited data are currently available from advanced-phase clinical studies to directly evaluate potential differences in safety and tolerability profiles between D1/D5 (D1-like) receptor–selective agonists and D2/D3 (D2-like) receptor–selective agonists in patients with PD. However, retrospective analyses and comparative open-label studies have suggested that apomorphine, which has a somewhat distinctive dopamine receptor pharmacology [24] compared with most other DAs, is associated with fewer AEs potentially related to D2/D3 receptor-selective activation; it may improve some nonmotor symptoms, such as sleep, mood disturbances, and constipation, and is associated with lower rates of ICDs than oral DAs such as pramipexole and ropinirole, which more selectively activate D2/D3 receptors than apomorphine, which also activates D4 and D1/D5 receptors [22], [91], [92]. Apomorphine is suggested to be relatively well tolerated in patients with psychosis and hallucinations, and small, open-label clinical studies have observed fewer hallucinations in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms following apomorphine treatment [92], [93], [94]. Rotigotine, another less-selective DA with affinity for D1 receptors in addition to D2/D3/D4 receptors, is also associated with lower incidence of ICDs, further suggesting that these AEs may be specifically linked to the selective activation of D2/D3 receptors [40], [91]. The clinical profile of newer, selective D1/D5 DAs is emerging. In a study of 13 adults with PD, acute administration of PF-06412562, the selective D1/D5 DA, resulted in a tolerable safety profile without causing substantial changes in cardiovascular parameters, such as the safety events observed previously with the selective D1/D5 DA ABT-431 [45], [48]. Similarly, no notable abnormalities in laboratory or electrocardiogram parameters were observed across early-phase studies of the selective D1/D5 DA tavapadon, with nausea and headache being the most-frequent AEs [50], [95]. In a phase 2 randomized study of 47 patients with early-stage PD, no apparent differences were noted between tavapadon-treated and placebo-treated cohorts in ICDs, as assessed by the Questionnaire for Impulsive Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, or in sleepiness, as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [50]. Tavapadon was also evaluated in a phase 2 randomized study of patients with advanced PD, although as previously mentioned, this study was terminated prior to completion [50], [96]. This study was not terminated because of safety concerns, and there\n",

DA, dopamine agonist; LSM, least-squares mean; MDS, Movement Disorder Society; PD, Parkinson’s disease; UPDRS, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The selective activation of dopamine receptor subtypes also has implications for the safety and tolerability profile of DAs. The 4 major dopaminergic pathways in the brain are the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, mesocortical, and tuberoinfundibular pathways (Fig. 1) [52]. Although DAs are targeted to address decreased dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway on the basis of its involvement in the coordination of movement and PD pathology as described above, DAs may also activate other dopaminergic pathways (e.g., tuberoinfundibular, mesocortical, and mesolimbic pathways) [52]. Such activation can affect endocrine function and cause behavioral and psychiatric AEs [17], [52], [53]. Importantly, while D1 and D2 receptors both show robust expression within the striatum, expression patterns in extrastriatal areas are more variable (Table 3) [20], [54], [55]. Although most data supporting direct comparisons of dopamine receptor subtype expression have been generated in preclinical models (e.g., rats and nonhuman primates), the overall patterns of receptor expression are often found to be translatable to humans, with the potential exception of differences in fine expression patterns within the cortex [56], [57]. In addition to dense staining of the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens (the primary targets of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine pathways, respectively), D1 receptors are also found in the cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and hypothalamus [55], [58], [59]. D5 receptors show a similar expression pattern, although with\n",
      "Neumann2023 chunk 30  the knock-out of receptors resides in the observation that this may lead in the heart to the activation of artificial signal transduction pathways. Thus, while genetically manipulated mice have been very important for understanding mechanisms, one has to be careful when translating these findings into the clinic, and one has to avoid pitfalls. D1-dopamine receptors in the brain (but as an unintended side effect, also in the heart) can be blocked by many antipsychotic drugs ([166], Table 1B). Interestingly, most antipsychotic drugs also block D2-dopamine receptors [185,186] (Table 1B). In patients with heart failure, the expression of D1-dopamine receptors [80] and of the D5-dopamine receptor in the heart was increased [170]. This might be a compensatory mechanism (see above). Lower concentrations of dopamine could theoretically dilate the coronary vessels via D1-dopamine receptors or β-adrenoceptors, but dopamine also induces vasoconstriction in isolated human coronary rings, probably via α1-adrenoceptors [140]. Moreover, in the human heart, dopamine could exert positive inotropic cardiac effects via the stimulation of α1-adrenoceptors, D1-dopamine receptors, or β-adrenoceptors [39]. Higher concentrations of dopamine in clinical situations would release noradrenaline: thus, dopamine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic drug and the released noradrenaline stimulates vasoconstriction via α1-adrenoceptors. As mentioned above, the published data are somewhat controversial. Even nowadays, dopamine is used in the clinic to raise blood pressure, for instance, in patients with sepsis [39]. There are data in patients that noted after intravenous infusion a direct positive inotropic effect of fenoldopam (a D1-dopamine receptor agonist) or propylbutyldopamine (a D2-dopamine receptor agonist), suggesting that the D1-dopamine receptor and the D2-dopamine receptor in the human heart can directly or indirectly increase the force of contraction [187]. A Japanese group convincingly reported on an increased cardiac expression of the mRNA for the D1-dopamine receptors in patients with heart failure, compared to the matched controls [80]. However, the protein data were lacking [80]. Moreover, these data would be expected to lead to a more effective positive inotropic effect of D1-dopamine receptor simulation, compared to β-adrenergic stimulation. Data in this regard are also not yet convincing. All dopamine agonists clinically used to treat Morbus Parkinson, besides the intended agonistic effects on D2-dopamine receptors, also have agonistic effects on D1-dopamine receptors [39,185] (see Table 1A for examples). If one gives patients L-DOPA without also supplying a decarboxylase-inhibitor, then one actually treats patients with dopamine because L-DOPA is quickly converted to dopamine in the periphery. D2-dopamine receptor agonists such as bromocriptine or pergolide have a higher potency on D2-dopamine receptors than D1-dopamine receptors. However, pergolide and bromocriptine have an affinity of 0.1 µM (as Ki) or 0.6 µM at D1-dopamine receptors; therefore, they can act as agonists at the D1-dopamine receptors [10] (Table 1A). Interestingly, dopamine appears to\n",
      "Neumann2023 chunk 28  contraction [63]). Nevertheless, this positive inotropic effect via the D1-dopamine receptors might present a protective mechanism when the cardiac inotropic function is compromised, to ensure that cardiac force can still be raised to meet the necessities of the body. From these experimental data, one can hypothesize also that the known upregulation of the mRNA of the D1-dopamine receptor in human heart failure [80] might serve to sustain force generation in human heart failure. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, a reduced activity of β-hydroxylase was noted in the heart ventricle, compared to normotensive control rats [173]. It was speculated that this defective degradation of dopamine might contribute to the genesis of hypertension [173]. This model has apparently not been studied further, and therefore, the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. During ischemia and hypoxia, dopamine can be released in the neuronal cells (e.g., [174,175]), and thus, high dopamine levels can be reached. If this mechanism also occurred in the heart, these ischemia-induced dopamine elevations might be able to stimulate D1-dopamine receptors, and thus they might induce arrhythmias. Fittingly, dopamine is known to induce cardiac arrhythmias in general [70,80,144], but especially in cardiac ischemia [176,177]. Simulated ischemia and reperfusion led in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to an increased expression (on protein level) of D1-dopamine receptors [78], but also a heightened expression of D2-dopamine receptor, which led to impaired mitochondrial function [78]. This might imply a certain relevance of D1-dopamine receptors in patients with myocardial infarction. Oxidative stress can reduce at least the mRNA for the D1-dopamine receptor [110]. The underlying mechanism may lie in the observation that oxidative stress blocks the activity of the transcription factors AP1 and SP3, and thereby reduces D1-dopamine receptor expression [110]. Hypoxia can raise the expression of D1-dopamine receptors (with Western blotting) in cultivated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes [78]. Blocking the D2-dopamine receptor by raclopride (Table 1B) in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes induced autophagy in these cells [178], likewise suggesting a role of D2-dopamine receptors in ischemia and hypoxia. Moreover, endothelin or angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy in isolated cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was attenuated by bromocriptine (Table 1A), suggesting that the D2-dopamine (or D1-dopamine receptor) might be involved in cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, in a genetic model of cardiomyopathy, the cardiomyopathic hamster, when the cardiomyopathy progressed, a decrease in the activity of the β-hydroxylase activity in the heart was reported. Hence, an increase in cardiac dopamine levels seems to correlate in this model with heart failure [179]. In experimental sepsis (the injection of lipopolysaccharide, a well-established model of sepsis), the blood–brain barrier may open, which is detrimental. The stimulation of the D2-dopamine receptors using the agonist cabergoline (Table 1A, 20 µM), possibly by closing the tight junctions, improves the barrier function under these conditions [180]. This might result from a stimulation of the D2-dopamine receptors on\n",

However, retrospective analyses and comparative open-label studies have suggested that apomorphine, which has a somewhat distinctive dopamine receptor pharmacology [24] compared with most other DAs, is associated with fewer AEs potentially related to D2/D3 receptor-selective activation; it may improve some nonmotor symptoms, such as sleep, mood disturbances, and constipation, and is associated with lower rates of ICDs than oral DAs such as pramipexole and ropinirole, which more selectively activate D2/D3 receptors than apomorphine, which also activates D4 and D1/D5 receptors [22], [91], [92].

In this review, we discuss evidence to date that suggests how a D1 and D5 dopamine receptor–selective (D1-like) partial agonist may have a distinct clinical efficacy and safety profile compared with that of currently approved D2- and D3-selective (D2-like) DAs. The basal ganglia of the brain are modeled with two functional circuits (direct and indirect pathways) that help translate cortical inputs into specific “go” (facilitation) and “stop” (suppression) signals from the thalamus to the broader motor system [29], [30]. This model posits that the go and stop signals are propagated through direct and indirect pathways, respectively, which project to the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), the primary output of basal ganglia [30]. GPi output exerts an inhibitory effect on thalamocortical neurons that promote movement [29]. Dopamine facilitates movement by stimulating the direct (go) pathway and inhibiting the indirect (stop) pathway [31]. Dopaminergic activation of direct pathway medium spiny neurons inhibits the GPi by releasing GABA, thereby promoting movement, whereas activation of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons inhibits GPi indirectly via the globus pallidus externa and subthalamic nucleus to promote movement [29], [32]. Ultimately, integration between the direct and indirect pathways produces coordinated motor output and fine temporal patterning of neural activity [29]. Of note, while all dopamine receptors are expressed in striatum, D1 receptors and D2 receptors are most abundantly expressed on striatal neurons [33]. Striatal D1 and D2 receptors are localized to distinct neuronal populations, with D1 receptors expressed on direct pathway neurons and D2 receptors expressed in the indirect pathway [26]. Specific or differential functional involvement of D3, D4, and D5 receptors in the striatal motor circuitry is less known, particularly due to relatively lower expression and nonselectivity of available tools [33], [34]. Most approved DAs primarily target D2/D3 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [21], [22], [24], [25]. Bromocriptine, one of the major earlier generation ergot-derived DAs, primarily activates D2/D3/D4 receptors [17], [35], [36]. Among other major ergoline DAs, pergolide activates D2/D3/D4 receptors but may also have some affinity for D1/D5 receptors [17], [24], [37], [38], [39]. Second-generation, nonergoline DAs (Table 1) such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, also primarily activate D2/D3/D4 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [17], [23], [24], [40]. Apomorphine has been proposed to act as a less-specific DA that activates all dopamine receptor subtypes, including D1/D5 receptors, although its affinity for D1 receptors is reported to be lower than that for other dopamine receptor subtypes [21], [22], [23].

Still, the relatively small treatment difference in dyskinesia combined with the overall superior efficacy of levodopa suggests that delaying treatment with levodopa in favor of D2/D3 DAs in early PD may not provide substantial long-term benefits [87].

The 4 major dopaminergic pathways in the brain are the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, mesocortical, and tuberoinfundibular pathways (Fig. 1) [52]. Although DAs are targeted to address decreased dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway on the basis of its involvement in the coordination of movement and PD pathology as described above, DAs may also activate other dopaminergic pathways (e.g., tuberoinfundibular, mesocortical, and mesolimbic pathways) [52]. Such activation can affect endocrine function and cause behavioral and psychiatric AEs [17], [52], [53]. Importantly, while D1 and D2 receptors both show robust expression within the striatum, expression patterns in extrastriatal areas are more variable (Table 3) [20], [54], [55].

Thus, while genetically manipulated mice have been very important for understanding mechanisms, one has to be careful when translating these findings into the clinic, and one has to avoid pitfalls. D1-dopamine receptors in the brain (but as an unintended side effect, also in the heart) can be blocked by many antipsychotic drugs ([166], Table 1B). Interestingly, most antipsychotic drugs also block D2-dopamine receptors [185,186] (Table 1B). In patients with heart failure, the expression of D1-dopamine receptors [80] and of the D5-dopamine receptor in the heart was increased [170]. This might be a compensatory mechanism (see above). Lower concentrations of dopamine could theoretically dilate the coronary vessels via D1-dopamine receptors or β-adrenoceptors, but dopamine also induces vasoconstriction in isolated human coronary rings, probably via α1-adrenoceptors [140]. Moreover, in the human heart, dopamine could exert positive inotropic cardiac effects via the stimulation of α1-adrenoceptors, D1-dopamine receptors, or β-adrenoceptors [39]. Higher concentrations of dopamine in clinical situations would release noradrenaline: thus, dopamine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic drug and the released noradrenaline stimulates vasoconstriction via α1-adrenoceptors. As mentioned above, the published data are somewhat controversial. Even nowadays, dopamine is used in the clinic to raise blood pressure, for instance, in patients with sepsis [39]. There are data in patients that noted after intravenous infusion a direct positive inotropic effect of fenoldopam (a D1-dopamine receptor agonist) or propylbutyldopamine (a D2-dopamine receptor agonist), suggesting that the D1-dopamine receptor and the D2-dopamine receptor in the human heart can directly or indirectly increase the force of contraction [187]. A Japanese group convincingly reported on an increased cardiac expression of the mRNA for the D1-dopamine receptors in patients with heart failure, compared to the matched controls [80]. However, the protein data were lacking [80]. Moreover, these data would be expected to lead to a more effective positive inotropic effect of D1-dopamine receptor simulation, compared to β-adrenergic stimulation. Data in this regard are also not yet convincing. All dopamine agonists clinically used to treat Morbus Parkinson, besides the intended agonistic effects on D2-dopamine receptors, also have agonistic effects on D1-dopamine receptors [39,185] (see Table 1A for examples). If one gives patients L-DOPA without also supplying a decarboxylase-inhibitor, then one actually treats patients with dopamine because L-DOPA is quickly converted to dopamine in the periphery. D2-dopamine receptor agonists such as bromocriptine or pergolide have a higher potency on D2-dopamine receptors than D1-dopamine receptors. However, pergolide and bromocriptine have an affinity of 0.1 µM (as Ki) or 0.6 µM at D1-dopamine receptors; therefore, they can act as agonists at the D1-dopamine receptors [10] (Table 1A).

In this review, we discuss evidence to date that suggests how a D1 and D5 dopamine receptor–selective (D1-like) partial agonist may have a distinct clinical efficacy and safety profile compared with that of currently approved D2- and D3-selective (D2-like) DAs. The basal ganglia of the brain are modeled with two functional circuits (direct and indirect pathways) that help translate cortical inputs into specific “go” (facilitation) and “stop” (suppression) signals from the thalamus to the broader motor system [29], [30]. This model posits that the go and stop signals are propagated through direct and indirect pathways, respectively, which project to the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), the primary output of basal ganglia [30]. GPi output exerts an inhibitory effect on thalamocortical neurons that promote movement [29]. Dopamine facilitates movement by stimulating the direct (go) pathway and inhibiting the indirect (stop) pathway [31]. Dopaminergic activation of direct pathway medium spiny neurons inhibits the GPi by releasing GABA, thereby promoting movement, whereas activation of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons inhibits GPi indirectly via the globus pallidus externa and subthalamic nucleus to promote movement [29], [32]. Ultimately, integration between the direct and indirect pathways produces coordinated motor output and fine temporal patterning of neural activity [29]. Of note, while all dopamine receptors are expressed in striatum, D1 receptors and D2 receptors are most abundantly expressed on striatal neurons [33]. Striatal D1 and D2 receptors are localized to distinct neuronal populations, with D1 receptors expressed on direct pathway neurons and D2 receptors expressed in the indirect pathway [26]. Specific or differential functional involvement of D3, D4, and D5 receptors in the striatal motor circuitry is less known, particularly due to relatively lower expression and nonselectivity of available tools [33], [34]. Most approved DAs primarily target D2/D3 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [21], [22], [24], [25]. Bromocriptine, one of the major earlier generation ergot-derived DAs, primarily activates D2/D3/D4 receptors [17], [35], [36]. Among other major ergoline DAs, pergolide activates D2/D3/D4 receptors but may also have some affinity for D1/D5 receptors [17], [24], [37], [38], [39]. Second-generation, nonergoline DAs (Table 1) such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, also primarily activate D2/D3/D4 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [17], [23], [24], [40]. Apomorphine has been proposed to act as a less-specific DA that activates all dopamine receptor subtypes, including D1/D5 receptors, although its affinity for D1 receptors is reported to be lower than that for other dopamine receptor subtypes [21], [22], [23]. However, apomorphine’s affinity for D1/D5 receptors is still considerably higher compared to other D2/D3 DAs such as pramipexole and ropinirole [24]. Among', 'source': 'Isaacson2023 chunk 3'}, {'original_text': '\\xa0years at diagnosis due to potential for reduced risk of troublesome dyskinesias associated with long-term treatment with levodopa [78]. This approach has been driven by observations that people with early-stage PD treated with D2/D3 DAs have reduced incidence of motor complications (e.g., wearing-OFF phenomena, dyskinesias) [89], [90]. Still, the relatively small treatment difference in dyskinesia combined with the overall superior efficacy of levodopa suggests that delaying treatment with levodopa in favor of D2/D3 DAs in early PD may not provide substantial long-term benefits [87]. Novel approaches that balance risk of motor (e.g., dyskinesias) versus nonmotor (e.g., ICDs, hallucinations) AEs across disease stages are needed. Limited data are currently available from advanced-phase clinical studies to directly evaluate potential differences in safety and tolerability profiles between D1/D5 (D1-like) receptor–selective agonists and D2/D3 (D2-like) receptor–selective agonists in patients with PD. However, retrospective analyses and comparative open-label studies have suggested that apomorphine, which has a somewhat distinctive dopamine receptor pharmacology [24] compared with most other DAs, is associated with fewer AEs potentially related to D2/D3 receptor-selective activation; it may improve some nonmotor symptoms, such as sleep, mood disturbances, and constipation, and is associated with lower rates of ICDs than oral DAs such as pramipexole and ropinirole, which more selectively activate D2/D3 receptors than apomorphine, which also activates D4 and D1/D5 receptors [22], [91], [92]. Apomorphine is suggested to be relatively well tolerated in patients with psychosis and hallucinations, and small, open-label clinical studies have observed fewer hallucinations in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms following apomorphine treatment [92], [93], [94]. Rotigotine, another less-selective DA with affinity for D1 receptors in addition to D2/D3/D4 receptors, is also associated with lower incidence of ICDs, further suggesting that these AEs may be specifically linked to the selective activation of D2/D3 receptors [40], [91]. The clinical profile of newer, selective D1/D5 DAs is emerging. In a study of 13 adults with PD, acute administration of PF-06412562, the selective D1/D5 DA, resulted in a tolerable safety profile without causing substantial changes in cardiovascular parameters, such as the safety events observed previously with the selective D1/D5 DA ABT-431 [45], [48]. Similarly, no notable abnormalities in laboratory or electrocardiogram parameters were observed across early-phase studies of the selective D1/D5 DA tavapadon, with nausea and headache being the most-frequent AEs [50], [95]. In a phase 2 randomized study of 47 patients with early-stage PD, no apparent differences were noted between tavapadon-treated and placebo-treated cohorts in ICDs, as assessed by the Questionnaire for Impulsive Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, or in sleepiness, as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [50]. Tavapadon was also evaluated in a phase 2 randomized study of patients with advanced PD, although as previously mentioned, this study was terminated prior to completion [50], [96]. This study was not terminated because of safety concerns, and there', 'source': 'Isaacson2023 chunk 10'}, {'original_text': \" hours compared with baseline [51].Table 2D1-selective DAs with available clinical evidence in PD.Name of DADopamine receptor selectivityCurrent clinical statusaEvidence of motor controlABT-431D1/D5 full [43], [45]Discontinued after pilot clinical study [45]Clinically and statistically significant difference relative to placebo in motor subsection of the UPDRS score in pilot study in advanced PD [45]DihydrexidineD1/D5 full [46], [47]Discontinued after pilot clinical study [46]3 of 4 patients did not have motor improvement; 1 patient had motor response similar to levodopa, as assessed by UPDRS motor score immediately after dosing in pilot study in mild/moderate PD [46]PF-06412562D1/D5 partial [48]Discontinued after phase 1 study [115]Clinically meaningful motor improvement relative to placebo, as assessed by LSM MDS–UPDRS Part III motor score in phase 1 study in all patients with PD [48]TavapadonD1/D5 partialPhase 3, ongoing [108], [109], [110]Significantly greater improvement in mean MDS-UPDRS Part III score at 15\\xa0weeks relative to placebo in phase 2 study in early-stage PD [50]aAs of July 2022.

The selective activation of dopamine receptor subtypes also has implications for the safety and tolerability profile of DAs. The 4 major dopaminergic pathways in the brain are the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, mesocortical, and tuberoinfundibular pathways (Fig. 1) [52]. Although DAs are targeted to address decreased dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway on the basis of its involvement in the coordination of movement and PD pathology as described above, DAs may also activate other dopaminergic pathways (e.g., tuberoinfundibular, mesocortical, and mesolimbic pathways) [52]. Such activation can affect endocrine function and cause behavioral and psychiatric AEs [17], [52], [53]. Importantly, while D1 and D2 receptors both show robust expression within the striatum, expression patterns in extrastriatal areas are more variable (Table 3) [20], [54], [55]. Although most data supporting direct comparisons of dopamine receptor subtype expression have been generated in preclinical models (e.g., rats and nonhuman primates), the overall patterns of receptor expression are often found to be translatable to humans, with the potential exception of differences in fine expression patterns within the cortex [56], [57]. In addition to dense staining of the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens (the primary targets of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine pathways, respectively), D1 receptors are also found in the cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and hypothalamus [55], [58], [59]. D5 receptors show a similar expression pattern, although with\", 'source': 'Isaacson2023 chunk 6'}, {'original_text': ' the knock-out of receptors resides in the observation that this may lead in the heart to the activation of artificial signal transduction pathways. Thus, while genetically manipulated mice have been very important for understanding mechanisms, one has to be careful when translating these findings into the clinic, and one has to avoid pitfalls. D1-dopamine receptors in the brain (but as an unintended side effect, also in the heart) can be blocked by many antipsychotic drugs ([166], Table 1B). Interestingly, most antipsychotic drugs also block D2-dopamine receptors [185,186] (Table 1B). In patients with heart failure, the expression of D1-dopamine receptors [80] and of the D5-dopamine receptor in the heart was increased [170]. This might be a compensatory mechanism (see above). Lower concentrations of dopamine could theoretically dilate the coronary vessels via D1-dopamine receptors or β-adrenoceptors, but dopamine also induces vasoconstriction in isolated human coronary rings, probably via α1-adrenoceptors [140]. Moreover, in the human heart, dopamine could exert positive inotropic cardiac effects via the stimulation of α1-adrenoceptors, D1-dopamine receptors, or β-adrenoceptors [39]. Higher concentrations of dopamine in clinical situations would release noradrenaline: thus, dopamine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic drug and the released noradrenaline stimulates vasoconstriction via α1-adrenoceptors. As mentioned above, the published data are somewhat controversial. Even nowadays, dopamine is used in the clinic to raise blood pressure, for instance, in patients with sepsis [39]. There are data in patients that noted after intravenous infusion a direct positive inotropic effect of fenoldopam (a D1-dopamine receptor agonist) or propylbutyldopamine (a D2-dopamine receptor agonist), suggesting that the D1-dopamine receptor and the D2-dopamine receptor in the human heart can directly or indirectly increase the force of contraction [187]. A Japanese group convincingly reported on an increased cardiac expression of the mRNA for the D1-dopamine receptors in patients with heart failure, compared to the matched controls [80]. However, the protein data were lacking [80]. Moreover, these data would be expected to lead to a more effective positive inotropic effect of D1-dopamine receptor simulation, compared to β-adrenergic stimulation. Data in this regard are also not yet convincing. All dopamine agonists clinically used to treat Morbus Parkinson, besides the intended agonistic effects on D2-dopamine receptors, also have agonistic effects on D1-dopamine receptors [39,185] (see Table 1A for examples). If one gives patients L-DOPA without also supplying a decarboxylase-inhibitor, then one actually treats patients with dopamine because L-DOPA is quickly converted to dopamine in the periphery. D2-dopamine receptor agonists such as bromocriptine or pergolide have a higher potency on D2-dopamine receptors than D1-dopamine receptors. However, pergolide and bromocriptine have an affinity of 0.1 µM (as Ki) or 0.6 µM at D1-dopamine receptors; therefore, they can act as agonists at the D1-dopamine receptors [10] (Table 1A). Interestingly, dopamine appears to', 'source': 'Neumann2023 chunk 30'}, {'original_text': ' contraction [63]). Nevertheless, this positive inotropic effect via the D1-dopamine receptors might present a protective mechanism when the cardiac inotropic function is compromised, to ensure that cardiac force can still be raised to meet the necessities of the body. From these experimental data, one can hypothesize also that the known upregulation of the mRNA of the D1-dopamine receptor in human heart failure [80] might serve to sustain force generation in human heart failure. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, a reduced activity of β-hydroxylase was noted in the heart ventricle, compared to normotensive control rats [173]. It was speculated that this defective degradation of dopamine might contribute to the genesis of hypertension [173]. This model has apparently not been studied further, and therefore, the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. During ischemia and hypoxia, dopamine can be released in the neuronal cells (e.g., [174,175]), and thus, high dopamine levels can be reached. If this mechanism also occurred in the heart, these ischemia-induced dopamine elevations might be able to stimulate D1-dopamine receptors, and thus they might induce arrhythmias. Fittingly, dopamine is known to induce cardiac arrhythmias in general [70,80,144], but especially in cardiac ischemia [176,177]. Simulated ischemia and reperfusion led in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to an increased expression (on protein level) of D1-dopamine receptors [78], but also a heightened expression of D2-dopamine receptor, which led to impaired mitochondrial function [78]. This might imply a certain relevance of D1-dopamine receptors in patients with myocardial infarction. Oxidative stress can reduce at least the mRNA for the D1-dopamine receptor [110]. The underlying mechanism may lie in the observation that oxidative stress blocks the activity of the transcription factors AP1 and SP3, and thereby reduces D1-dopamine receptor expression [110]. Hypoxia can raise the expression of D1-dopamine receptors (with Western blotting) in cultivated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes [78]. Blocking the D2-dopamine receptor by raclopride (Table 1B) in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes induced autophagy in these cells [178], likewise suggesting a role of D2-dopamine receptors in ischemia and hypoxia. Moreover, endothelin or angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy in isolated cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was attenuated by bromocriptine (Table 1A), suggesting that the D2-dopamine (or D1-dopamine receptor) might be involved in cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, in a genetic model of cardiomyopathy, the cardiomyopathic hamster, when the cardiomyopathy progressed, a decrease in the activity of the β-hydroxylase activity in the heart was reported. Hence, an increase in cardiac dopamine levels seems to correlate in this model with heart failure [179]. In experimental sepsis (the injection of lipopolysaccharide, a well-established model of sepsis), the blood–brain barrier may open, which is detrimental. The stimulation of the D2-dopamine receptors using the agonist cabergoline (Table 1A, 20 µM), possibly by closing the tight junctions, improves the barrier function under these conditions [180]. This might result from a stimulation of the D2-dopamine receptors on', 'source': 'Neumann2023 chunk 28'}])\n"
