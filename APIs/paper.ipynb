      "answer: Dopamine 1 receptors (D1) play a crucial role in Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment and symptom management. Selective activation of D1-like receptors has demonstrated distinct clinical efficacy compared to D2-like receptors, particularly in promoting movement by inhibiting the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) (Isaacson2023 chunk 3). For example, the D1-like partial agonist Tavapadon showed significant improvement in mean MDS-UPDRS Part III scores in early-stage PD patients (Isaacson2023 chunk 6). Additionally, D1 receptors influence safety, tolerability, and behavioral side effects due to their expression in extrastriatal areas (Isaacson2023 chunk 6). Overall, D1 receptors are integral to understanding and optimizing PD therapies.\n",

D1-selective DAs with available clinical evidence in PD. As of July 2022. DA, dopamine agonist; LSM, least-squares mean; MDS, Movement Disorder Society; PD, Parkinson’s disease; UPDRS, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The selective activation of dopamine receptor subtypes also has implications for the safety and tolerability profile of DAs. The 4 major dopaminergic pathways in the brain are the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, mesocortical, and tuberoinfundibular pathways (Fig. 1) [52]. Although DAs are targeted to address decreased dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway on the basis of its involvement in the coordination of movement and PD pathology as described above, DAs may also activate other dopaminergic pathways (e.g., tuberoinfundibular, mesocortical, and mesolimbic pathways) [52]. Such activation can affect endocrine function and cause behavioral and psychiatric AEs [17], [52], [53]. Importantly, while D1 and D2 receptors both show robust expression within the striatum, expression patterns in extrastriatal areas are more variable (Table 3) [20], [54], [55]. Although most data supporting direct comparisons of dopamine receptor subtype expression have been generated in preclinical models (e.g., rats and nonhuman primates), the overall patterns of receptor expression are often found to be translatable to humans, with the potential exception of differences in fine expression patterns within the cortex [56], [57]. In addition to dense staining of the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens (the primary targets of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine pathways, respectively), D1 receptors are also found in the cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and hypothalamus [55], [58], [59]. D5 receptors show a similar expression pattern, although with\n",
      "Isaacson2023 chunk 3 eg, ergoline versus non-ergoline), receptor subtype selectivity, and intrinsic activity on the receptor (ie, full agonism with maximal stimulation versus partial agonism with submaximal activation) [17], [28]. In this review, we discuss evidence to date that suggests how a D1 and D5 dopamine receptor–selective (D1-like) partial agonist may have a distinct clinical efficacy and safety profile compared with that of currently approved D2- and D3-selective (D2-like) DAs. The basal ganglia of the brain are modeled with two functional circuits (direct and indirect pathways) that help translate cortical inputs into specific “go” (facilitation) and “stop” (suppression) signals from the thalamus to the broader motor system [29], [30]. This model posits that the go and stop signals are propagated through direct and indirect pathways, respectively, which project to the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), the primary output of basal ganglia [30]. GPi output exerts an inhibitory effect on thalamocortical neurons that promote movement [29]. Dopamine facilitates movement by stimulating the direct (go) pathway and inhibiting the indirect (stop) pathway [31]. Dopaminergic activation of direct pathway medium spiny neurons inhibits the GPi by releasing GABA, thereby promoting movement, whereas activation of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons inhibits GPi indirectly via the globus pallidus externa and subthalamic nucleus to promote movement [29], [32]. Ultimately, integration between the direct and indirect pathways produces coordinated motor output and fine temporal patterning of neural activity [29]. Of note, while all dopamine receptors are expressed in striatum, D1 receptors and D2 receptors are most abundantly expressed on striatal neurons [33]. Striatal D1 and D2 receptors are localized to distinct neuronal populations, with D1 receptors expressed on direct pathway neurons and D2 receptors expressed in the indirect pathway [26]. Specific or differential functional involvement of D3, D4, and D5 receptors in the striatal motor circuitry is less known, particularly due to relatively lower expression and nonselectivity of available tools [33], [34]. Most approved DAs primarily target D2/D3 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [21], [22], [24], [25]. Bromocriptine, one of the major earlier generation ergot-derived DAs, primarily activates D2/D3/D4 receptors [17], [35], [36]. Among other major ergoline DAs, pergolide activates D2/D3/D4 receptors but may also have some affinity for D1/D5 receptors [17], [24], [37], [38], [39]. Second-generation, nonergoline DAs (Table 1) such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, also primarily activate D2/D3/D4 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [17], [23], [24], [40]. Apomorphine has been proposed to act as a less-specific DA that activates all dopamine receptor subtypes, including D1/D5 receptors, although its affinity for D1 receptors is reported to be lower than that for other dopamine receptor subtypes [21], [22], [23]. However, apomorphine’s affinity for D1/D5 receptors is still considerably higher compared to other D2/D3 DAs such as pramipexole and ropinirole [24]. Among\n",
      "Neumann2023 chunk 30  the knock-out of receptors resides in the observation that this may lead in the heart to the activation of artificial signal transduction pathways. Thus, while genetically manipulated mice have been very important for understanding mechanisms, one has to be careful when translating these findings into the clinic, and one has to avoid pitfalls. D1-dopamine receptors in the brain (but as an unintended side effect, also in the heart) can be blocked by many antipsychotic drugs ([166], Table 1B). Interestingly, most antipsychotic drugs also block D2-dopamine receptors [185,186] (Table 1B). In patients with heart failure, the expression of D1-dopamine receptors [80] and of the D5-dopamine receptor in the heart was increased [170]. This might be a compensatory mechanism (see above). Lower concentrations of dopamine could theoretically dilate the coronary vessels via D1-dopamine receptors or β-adrenoceptors, but dopamine also induces vasoconstriction in isolated human coronary rings, probably via α1-adrenoceptors [140]. Moreover, in the human heart, dopamine could exert positive inotropic cardiac effects via the stimulation of α1-adrenoceptors, D1-dopamine receptors, or β-adrenoceptors [39]. Higher concentrations of dopamine in clinical situations would release noradrenaline: thus, dopamine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic drug and the released noradrenaline stimulates vasoconstriction via α1-adrenoceptors. As mentioned above, the published data are somewhat controversial. Even nowadays, dopamine is used in the clinic to raise blood pressure, for instance, in patients with sepsis [39]. There are data in patients that noted after intravenous infusion a direct positive inotropic effect of fenoldopam (a D1-dopamine receptor agonist) or propylbutyldopamine (a D2-dopamine receptor agonist), suggesting that the D1-dopamine receptor and the D2-dopamine receptor in the human heart can directly or indirectly increase the force of contraction [187]. A Japanese group convincingly reported on an increased cardiac expression of the mRNA for the D1-dopamine receptors in patients with heart failure, compared to the matched controls [80]. However, the protein data were lacking [80]. Moreover, these data would be expected to lead to a more effective positive inotropic effect of D1-dopamine receptor simulation, compared to β-adrenergic stimulation. Data in this regard are also not yet convincing. All dopamine agonists clinically used to treat Morbus Parkinson, besides the intended agonistic effects on D2-dopamine receptors, also have agonistic effects on D1-dopamine receptors [39,185] (see Table 1A for examples). If one gives patients L-DOPA without also supplying a decarboxylase-inhibitor, then one actually treats patients with dopamine because L-DOPA is quickly converted to dopamine in the periphery. D2-dopamine receptor agonists such as bromocriptine or pergolide have a higher potency on D2-dopamine receptors than D1-dopamine receptors. However, pergolide and bromocriptine have an affinity of 0.1 µM (as Ki) or 0.6 µM at D1-dopamine receptors; therefore, they can act as agonists at the D1-dopamine receptors [10] (Table 1A). Interestingly, dopamine appears to\n",
      "Rosaria2022 chunk 39 , is involved in the integration of neural activities controlling consummatory (erectile–ejaculatory) and anticipatory (motivational and rewarding) aspects of copulatory behavior in physiological contexts. Accordingly, the levels of extracellular dopamine and its metabolite DOPAC increase in the nucleus accumbens (see above) and in the PVN as well of sexually active male rats in the presence of an inaccessible receptive female rat, when noncontact erections take place, and even more during copulation (e.g., when in copula penile erections take place) [140]. Thus, this neural circuit contributes at the same time to the consummatory aspects of sexual behavior and may also influence mesolimbic/mesocortical dopaminergic neurons supplying a neural substrate to explain the well-known rewarding properties of sexual behavior (see [250,303,311,312]). In fact, as recalled above, mesolimbic/mesocortical dopaminergic neurons have a key role in the motivational and rewarding properties of the natural reinforcing stimuli, such as food, water and sexual behavior (see [303,313,314]). In particular, dopamine released from these neurons is thought to be involved in the transposition of the motivational aspects of natural stimuli into goal directed behaviors, as it may be the seeking of a sexual partner and of sexual intercourse to reach reward and satisfaction for sexual activity, [315]. More recent studies on this matter show that the extracellular dopamine increase in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex is correlated to the dopaminergic tone of the male rats, which determines their pattern of copulatory performance. Accordingly, rat sub-lines with a grater dopaminergic tone than their control counterparts obtained by selective breeding protocols over multiple generations for showing opposite specific behavioral tracts (i.e., RHA versus RLA rats, bNEHR versus bNELR rats), a specific spontaneous behavioral response (LY versus HY rats) or by genetic mutations (DAT-KO versus HET and WT rats) show improved erectile function and copulatory behavior and specific patterns of copulation that occur in parallel with changes in dopamine activity in the nucleus accumbens and in the medial prefrontal cortex when compared to their lower dopaminergic tone counterparts [255,296,316]. The fact that rat sub-lines psychogenetically selected for showing specific (often opposite and contrasting) traits or even to show a spontaneous behavior or not, over multiple generations, show similar differences in sexual behavior and that a different dopaminergic tone present in these rat sub-lines, which resembles that of DAT-KO rats versus HET and WT rats, plays a main role in these differences deserves some comment. First, it is feasible that the behavioral differences between the above rat sub-lines are related to genetic and environmental factors, which concur with modifications in sexual behavior, related to alterations in the function of brain neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, although other neurotransmitters may be involved, such as noradrenaline and also serotonin). This raises the possibility that, depending on the behavioral criteria on which the psychogenetic selection is based, phenotypes may be generated that are strongly related to each other not only in behavioral traits but also in sharing central and/or peripheral neural and neuroendocrine substrates of their different behavioral patterns. This makes psychogenetically selected animal sub-lines important animal models to study associations between neurotransmitters function and behavior\n",
      "Neumann2023 chunk 29 oline (Table 1A, 20 µM), possibly by closing the tight junctions, improves the barrier function under these conditions [180]. This might result from a stimulation of the D2-dopamine receptors on the endothelial cells in the brain. However, cabergoline is a very promiscuous drug: it is an agonist at various serotonin receptors, an antagonist at adrenergic receptors, and it has a pKi of 6.7 at the D1-dopamine receptors [1,181]. Hence, one could argue that the D1-dopamine receptor was involved, as 20 µM cabergoline would effectively also stimulate the D1-dopamine receptor. Hence, studies with more selective agonists or genetically manipulated mice are necessary, to better understand the role of dopamine receptors in sepsis. One could regard malaria as an infectious disease possibly leading to sepsis. In the brains of mice with experimental malaria, the expression of D1-dopamine receptors (and D2-dopamine receptors) was enhanced on a protein level. Fittingly, the phosphorylation state of DARPP32, the phosphorylation state of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Figure 2), and the expression of PLC (Figure 1) in the brains of these mice were found to be elevated [182], suggesting that infections can affect the expression and function of dopamine receptors. The hearts of these animals were regrettably not studied, which might have answered the question as to what role dopamine receptors in the heart play in cardiac inflammation, specifically malaria-induced inflammation. The stimulation of the D5-dopamine receptor could alleviate the symptoms of bacterial experimental sepsis in mice [183]. This was explained on a molecular base in the following way. D5-dopamine receptors form a complex involving PP2A (Figure 2) that inhibits the proinflammatory pathway that is activated via TLR2-receptors in leucocytes [183]. However, looking closely at their data, infection also increased the expression of the D1-dopamine receptor, but less than the expression of the D5-dopamine receptors [183]. However, as noted above, the D1- and D5-dopamine receptors belong the same family of dopamine receptors. Thus, these data support a role of dopamine receptors in cardiac inflammation, and they might indicate a clinically useful beneficial role of “D1-like” receptors against myocarditis. In experimental sepsis (through intestinal puncture) in rats, dopamine turned out to be less potent and effective than the pure β-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine, compared with rats without sepsis [184]. Here, the problem is obvious that the effect of dopamine is most probably via the adrenergic receptors, and a role of the cardiac dopamine receptors remains hypothetical, as dopamine in the rat heart would preferentially, if not exclusively, act on the adrenergic receptors (Table 2). As always, it should be kept in mind that overexpression and knock-out mouse models are helpful in understanding, for instance, the role of dopamine receptors. However, there are species differences between mice and humans. Some receptors are functionally absent in mice, and their cardiac knock-out will thus not lead further. Moreover, one problem with overexpression and the knock-out of receptors resides in the observation that this may lead in the heart to the activation of artificial signal transduction pathways. Thus, while genetically manipulated mice have been very important for understanding mechanisms, one has to be careful\n",

Most approved DAs primarily target D2/D3 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [21], [22], [24], [25]. Bromocriptine, one of the major earlier generation ergot-derived DAs, primarily activates D2/D3/D4 receptors [17], [35], [36]. Among other major ergoline DAs, pergolide activates D2/D3/D4 receptors but may also have some affinity for D1/D5 receptors [17], [24], [37], [38], [39]. Second-generation, nonergoline DAs (Table 1) such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, also primarily activate D2/D3/D4 (D2-like) dopamine receptors [17], [23], [24], [40]. Apomorphine has been proposed to act as a less-specific DA that activates all dopamine receptor subtypes, including D1/D5 receptors, although its affinity for D1 receptors is reported to be lower than that for other dopamine receptor subtypes [21], [22], [23]. However, apomorphine’s affinity for D1/D5 receptors is still considerably higher compared to other D2/D3 DAs such as pramipexole and ropinirole [24].

Additionally, it mentions that \"D1-dopamine receptors in the heart were increased\" in heart failure patients, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms. While dopamine\\'s pathways in the heart are complex, their interaction with both D1 and D2 receptors is emphasized.\\n\\n7', 'original_text': ' the knock-out of receptors resides in the observation that this may lead in the heart to the activation of artificial signal transduction pathways. Thus, while genetically manipulated mice have been very important for understanding mechanisms, one has to be careful when translating these findings into the clinic, and one has to avoid pitfalls. D1-dopamine receptors in the brain (but as an unintended side effect, also in the heart) can be blocked by many antipsychotic drugs ([166], Table 1B). Interestingly, most antipsychotic drugs also block D2-dopamine receptors [185,186] (Table 1B). In patients with heart failure, the expression of D1-dopamine receptors [80] and of the D5-dopamine receptor in the heart was increased [170]. This might be a compensatory mechanism (see above). Lower concentrations of dopamine could theoretically dilate the coronary vessels via D1-dopamine receptors or β-adrenoceptors, but dopamine also induces vasoconstriction in isolated human coronary rings, probably via α1-adrenoceptors [140]. Moreover, in the human heart, dopamine could exert positive inotropic cardiac effects via the stimulation of α1-adrenoceptors, D1-dopamine receptors, or β-adrenoceptors [39]. Higher concentrations of dopamine in clinical situations would release noradrenaline: thus, dopamine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic drug and the released noradrenaline stimulates vasoconstriction via α1-adrenoceptors. As mentioned above, the published data are somewhat controversial. Even nowadays, dopamine is used in the clinic to raise blood pressure, for instance, in patients with sepsis [39]. There are data in patients that noted after intravenous infusion a direct positive inotropic effect of fenoldopam (a D1-dopamine receptor agonist) or propylbutyldopamine (a D2-dopamine receptor agonist), suggesting that the D1-dopamine receptor and the D2-dopamine receptor in the human heart can directly or indirectly increase the force of contraction [187]. A Japanese group convincingly reported on an increased cardiac expression of the mRNA for the D1-dopamine receptors in patients with heart failure, compared to the matched controls [80]. However, the protein data were lacking [80]. Moreover, these data would be expected to lead to a more effective positive inotropic effect of D1-dopamine receptor simulation, compared to β-adrenergic stimulation. Data in this regard are also not yet convincing. All dopamine agonists clinically used to treat Morbus Parkinson, besides the intended agonistic effects on D2-dopamine receptors, also have agonistic effects on D1-dopamine receptors [39,185] (see Table 1A for examples). If one gives patients L-DOPA without also supplying a decarboxylase-inhibitor, then one actually treats patients with dopamine because L-DOPA is quickly converted to dopamine in the periphery. D2-dopamine receptor agonists such as bromocriptine or pergolide have a higher potency on D2-dopamine receptors than D1-dopamine receptors. However, pergolide and bromocriptine have an affinity of 0.1 µM (as Ki) or 0.6 µM at D1-dopamine receptors; therefore, they can act as agonists at the D1-dopamine receptors [10] (Table 1A). Interestingly, dopamine appears to', 'source': 'Neumann2023 chunk 30', 'relevance_score': 7}, {'summary': \"The excerpt discusses the role of dopamine in sexual behavior and its correlation with dopaminergic activity in male rats. Specifically, it shows that increased extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex enhance copulatory performance and erectile function. This is further highlighted by differences in sexual behavior observed in genetically distinct rat sub-lines, which implies that variations in dopaminergic tone influence behavior. Such findings potentially relate to Parkinson's disease, where dopamine receptor dysfunction is a key feature. The text underscores the significance of dopamine in both motivational aspects and consummatory behaviors. \\n\\n7\", 'original_text': ', is involved in the integration of neural activities controlling consummatory (erectile–ejaculatory) and anticipatory (motivational and rewarding) aspects of copulatory behavior in physiological contexts. Accordingly, the levels of extracellular dopamine and its metabolite DOPAC increase in the nucleus accumbens (see above) and in the PVN as well of sexually active male rats in the presence of an inaccessible receptive female rat, when noncontact erections take place, and even more during copulation (e.g., when in copula penile erections take place) [140]. Thus, this neural circuit contributes at the same time to the consummatory aspects of sexual behavior and may also influence mesolimbic/mesocortical dopaminergic neurons supplying a neural substrate to explain the well-known rewarding properties of sexual behavior (see [250,303,311,312]). In fact, as recalled above, mesolimbic/mesocortical dopaminergic neurons have a key role in the motivational and rewarding properties of the natural reinforcing stimuli, such as food, water and sexual behavior (see [303,313,314]). In particular, dopamine released from these neurons is thought to be involved in the transposition of the motivational aspects of natural stimuli into goal directed behaviors, as it may be the seeking of a sexual partner and of sexual intercourse to reach reward and satisfaction for sexual activity, [315]. More recent studies on this matter show that the extracellular dopamine increase in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex is correlated to the dopaminergic tone of the male rats, which determines their pattern of copulatory performance. Accordingly, rat sub-lines with a grater dopaminergic tone than their control counterparts obtained by selective breeding protocols over multiple generations for showing opposite specific behavioral tracts (i.e., RHA versus RLA rats, bNEHR versus bNELR rats), a specific spontaneous behavioral response (LY versus HY rats) or by genetic mutations (DAT-KO versus HET and WT rats) show improved erectile function and copulatory behavior and specific patterns of copulation that occur in parallel with changes in dopamine activity in the nucleus accumbens and in the medial prefrontal cortex when compared to their lower dopaminergic tone counterparts [255,296,316]. The fact that rat sub-lines psychogenetically selected for showing specific (often opposite and contrasting) traits or even to show a spontaneous behavior or not, over multiple generations, show similar differences in sexual behavior and that a different dopaminergic tone present in these rat sub-lines, which resembles that of DAT-KO rats versus HET and WT rats, plays a main role in these differences deserves some comment. First, it is feasible that the behavioral differences between the above rat sub-lines are related to genetic and environmental factors, which concur with modifications in sexual behavior, related to alterations in the function of brain neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, although other neurotransmitters may be involved, such as noradrenaline and also serotonin). This raises the possibility that, depending on the behavioral criteria on which the psychogenetic selection is based, phenotypes may be generated that are strongly related to each other not only in behavioral traits but also in sharing central and/or peripheral neural and neuroendocrine substrates of their different behavioral patterns. This makes psychogenetically selected animal sub-lines important animal models to study associations between neurotransmitters function and behavior', 'source': 'Rosaria2022 chunk 39', 'relevance_score': 7}, {'summary': 'The excerpt discusses the role of dopamine receptors, particularly the D1 and D5 receptors, in various pathological conditions including infections and inflammation. It notes that \"the expression of D1-dopamine receptors...was enhanced on a protein level\" in mice with experimental malaria. Additionally, the activation of the D5-dopamine receptor \"inhibits the pro-inflammatory pathway\" in leukocytes. Although focused on sepsis and cardiac inflammation, it emphasizes the complex roles of dopamine receptors in response to inflammation and infection, which may correlate with the dopaminergic dysfunction observed in Parkinson\\'s disease.\\n\\n6', 'original_text': 'oline (Table 1A, 20 µM), possibly by closing the tight junctions, improves the barrier function under these conditions [180]. This might result from a stimulation of the D2-dopamine receptors on the endothelial cells in the brain. However, cabergoline is a very promiscuous drug: it is an agonist at various serotonin receptors, an antagonist at adrenergic receptors, and it has a pKi of 6.7 at the D1-dopamine receptors [1,181]. Hence, one could argue that the D1-dopamine receptor was involved, as 20 µM cabergoline would effectively also stimulate the D1-dopamine receptor. Hence, studies with more selective agonists or genetically manipulated mice are necessary, to better understand the role of dopamine receptors in sepsis. One could regard malaria as an infectious disease possibly leading to sepsis. In the brains of mice with experimental malaria, the expression of D1-dopamine receptors (and D2-dopamine receptors) was enhanced on a protein level. Fittingly, the phosphorylation state of DARPP32, the phosphorylation state of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Figure 2), and the expression of PLC (Figure 1) in the brains of these mice were found to be elevated [182], suggesting that infections can affect the expression and function of dopamine receptors. The hearts of these animals were regrettably not studied, which might have answered the question as to what role dopamine receptors in the heart play in cardiac inflammation, specifically malaria-induced inflammation. The stimulation of the D5-dopamine receptor could alleviate the symptoms of bacterial experimental sepsis in mice [183]. This was explained on a molecular base in the following way. D5-dopamine receptors form a complex involving PP2A (Figure 2) that inhibits the proinflammatory pathway that is activated via TLR2-receptors in leucocytes [183]. However, looking closely at their data, infection also increased the expression of the D1-dopamine receptor, but less than the expression of the D5-dopamine receptors [183]. However, as noted above, the D1- and D5-dopamine receptors belong the same family of dopamine receptors. Thus, these data support a role of dopamine receptors in cardiac inflammation, and they might indicate a clinically useful beneficial role of “D1-like” receptors against myocarditis. In experimental sepsis (through intestinal puncture) in rats, dopamine turned out to be less potent and effective than the pure β-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine, compared with rats without sepsis [184]. Here, the problem is obvious that the effect of dopamine is most probably via the adrenergic receptors, and a role of the cardiac dopamine receptors remains hypothetical, as dopamine in the rat heart would preferentially, if not exclusively, act on the adrenergic receptors (Table 2). As always, it should be kept in mind that overexpression and knock-out mouse models are helpful in understanding, for instance, the role of dopamine receptors. However, there are species differences between mice and humans. Some receptors are functionally absent in mice, and their cardiac knock-out will thus not lead further. Moreover, one problem with overexpression and the knock-out of receptors resides in the observation that this may lead in the heart to the activation of artificial signal transduction pathways. Thus, while genetically manipulated mice have been very important for understanding mechanisms, one has to be careful', 'source': 'Neumann2023 chunk 29', 'relevance_score': 6}])\n",
