    "### Develop a scientific rationale for the following:\n",
    "                             \n",
    "    **Given target:** Gamma secretase\n",
    "    **Given disease:** Alzheimer's disease\n",
    "    **Given mode of action:** Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Context:\n",
    "Aβ is a family of secreted peptides generated from the sequential cleavages of the type 1 membrane protein APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and gamma-secretase (GSEC), respectively. \n",
    "BACE cleaves APP in the luminal domain, releasing the N-terminal soluble APPβ domain and leaving the C-terminal fragment, APP-CTF, which remains in the membrane. \n",
    "Subsequently, the APP-CTF is recruited to GSEC, a complex comprising four subunits, including PS, which harbors the active site. GSEC first cuts APP-CTF at the epsilon-cleavage site located close to the inner leaflet of the membrane. \n",
    "This cleavage event produces either Aβ48 or Aβ49 and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The membrane-retained Aβ48 or Aβ49 is then further processed by GSEC in a continuous cascade of proteolytical events at every third of fourth amino acid, where the N-terminal product of each reaction becomes the substrate for the next GSEC cleavage event.\n",
    "Accordingly, GSEC processes APP-CTF along two main product lines, Aβ49 → 46 → 43 → 40 → 37… and Aβ48 → 45 → 42 → 38…, respectively. During this processing cascade, Aβ43 and shorter Aβ peptides stochastically escape further processing by GSEC and are released into the extracellular space. \n",
    "As a result, Aβ peptides varying from 30 to 43 amino acids in length are secreted into the extracellular space. Among all secreted Aβ, Aβ40 is the most abundant in human CSF, followed by Aβ38, Aβ42, and Aβ37. In cognitively normal individuals, Aβ42 and Aβ43 represent a smaller portion of the total secreted Aβ.\n",
    "These longer forms of Aβ seed the formation of Aβ-amyloid aggregates, a key step in the formation of amyloid plaques (Veugelen et al., 2016), as illustrated in Figure 1. Aβ42, which is produced in higher amounts than Aβ43, is the most abundant Aβ in amyloid plaques (Welander et al., 2009).\n",

Recent cryo-EM structures show that semagacestat and avagacestat bind close to the critical mixed \\u03b2-sheath that stabilizes APP and Notch in the catalytic cleft of \\u03b3-secretase (Fig.\\u00a03) (Zhou et al, 2019; Yang et al, 2019). While it seems unlikely that GSIs will be reconsidered in the future for the treatment of AD because of these side effects, (selective) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition might be useful in other therapeutic areas (Jurisch-Yaksi et al, 2013), for instance, various cancers (Habets et al, 2019; Ranganathan et al, 2011) and hearing loss (Tona et al, 2014) among others, especially when Notch signaling is involved (Christopoulos et al, 2021; McCaw et al, 2021). Actually, nirogacestat (Ogsiveo) is the first GSI that reached regulatory approval for rare desmoid tumors (Gounder et al, 2023). While developing such Notch inhibitors, it is important to take into account that at least four different \\u03b3-secretase complexes exist (see main text: The discovery of \\u03b3-secretases) resulting from the four possible combinations of the constituting subunits PSEN1 or 2, APH1A or B, NCT, and PSENEN. These complexes have tissue-specific roles in Notch signaling as demonstrated by experiments with MRK560 (Churcher et al, 2006; Best et al, 2006), a GSI that suppresses T-cell Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (Habets et al, 2019) without the classical Notch-related toxicity seen with broad spectrum GSIs\\u00a0in gut, skin or thymus. The compound MRK560 is selective for PSEN1 above PSEN2 \\u03b3-secretase, and PSEN2-\\u03b3-secretase is able to maintain the Notch physiological function in the gut and skin. The compound MRK560 was not further developed as a clinical candidate because of CYP2C9 inhibition liability (Zhao et al, 2015). Recent structural information explains the specificity of MRK560 at the molecular level (Guo et al, 2022; Serneels et al, 2023). It is thus possible to exploit the relatively small differences between the different complexes to make selective and more safe medication. In a recent comparison of 12 GSIs (Serneels et al, 2023), a few showed slight preference for APH1B over APH1A. New cryo-EM structures should explore the structural differences between APH1A or APH1B-containing complexes, which should help to generate specific drugs against APH1B-containing complexes; these are involved in amyloid plaque generation in an AD mouse model (Serneels et al, 2009). A pivotal study linked inherited forms of AD to missense mutations in S182, a gene of unknown function at that time (Sherrington et al, 1995). Soon thereafter, mutations in a second, homologous gene were identified (Rogaev et al, 1995). The genes were called PSEN1 (abbreviation for Presenilin 1) and PSEN2 to indicate their relationship with \\u201cpresenile\\u201d early-onset AD (Rogaev et al, 1995). The function of PSENs was completely unknown, but similarities with other genes encoding multi-transmembrane domain proteins led to spec\",\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

Upregulation of tau was coupled with enhanced stress-inducible markers and vulnerability of cells to proteotoxic, excitotoxic, and mitochondrial stressors [43]. iPSCs with MAPT mutations N279K, P301L, and E10 + 16 had neuritis outgrowth deficiencies [44]. The iPSCs were prepared separately, and their phenotypes manifested accumulations of tau protein, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defects of nerve growth and differentiation [45]. Mutations in the PSEN-1 gene account for approximately 50% of the pathogenesis of early onset of AD and are the most common gene mutations in this disease [47]. Although gene mutations are responsible for early onset of AD, 95% of AD cases are late-onset diseases and are not necessarily caused by genetic mutations [48]. Late-onset AD can be caused by mutations in the PSEN-1 gene; such mutations account for 25% of cases of late-onset AD [49]. The PSEN-1 gene is an important regulator of \\u03b3-secretase in early- and late-onset AD (Figure 2). \\u03b3-secretase cleaves >90 different substrates. Studies of the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP and Notch have focused on AD and cancer [50]. Complete inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase, as achieved by nonselective \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), abolishes all \\u03b3-secretase activity, leading to decreased A\\u03b2 production and Notch signaling. A recent publication used cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structures of the \\u03b3-secretase basis of the APP-C83 fragment and the structures of the \\u03b3-secretase basis of the Notch 100 fragment [51]. This will help in the development of substrate-specific \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors or modulators. Therefore, we discuss the development of GSIs and \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) in clinical settings. Most of the mutations in the PSEN-1 gene are single nucleotide substitution mutations, which are missense mutations. PSEN-1 mutations cause an increase in the production of amyloid-\\u03b2 protein (~90% 40-residue amyloid beta-protein and ~10% 42-residue amyloid beta-protein) [52,53,54]. PSEN-1 is one of the components of \\u03b3-secretase [55]. The drugs\\u2019 development strategies are through inhibition cleaved by \\u03b3-secretase and reducing the production of amyloid-\\u03b2 protein [56,57]. However, the mechanism to treat Alzheimer\\u2019s disease led to no improvement with cognitive function and accompanying adverse side effects led to failure [58]. Despite the initial failure of GSIs to treat Alzheimer\\u2019s disease successfully, these inhibitors are still considered to have potential. \\u03b3-secretase suppresses the expression of the intracellular domain of the Notch protein (NICD), which represents a failure of this strategy, because the Notch protein plays a key role in the function of adult neural stem cells [59], affecting the differentiation and proliferation of neurons [60]. Development of GSIs must account for the effect on the Notch signals (Figure 3), and GSIs can produce cell toxicity by increasing the levels of APP carboxy-terminal fragments (\\u03b2-CTF) [61].

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

      "    \"summary: Gamma-secretase (\\u03b3S) is a multifactor complex crucial for cleaving Notch receptors and activating Notch signaling, particularly through its proteolytic processing at the S3 cleavage site. \\u03b3S plays a significant role not only in Notch signaling but also in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it influences amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and subsequent amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide production. First tested in cancer in 2006, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI) like MK-0752 were repurposed from AD studies but demonstrated only limited efficacy against T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and had significant toxicity, leading to trial discontinuation. \\n\\n8\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \" This observation opens up a new field of study for different O-glycans to fine-tune the strength of Notch signaling by the modification of the sugar residues of the NICD. The most widely used mechanism of action that is employed by small-molecule inhibitors relates to the proteolytic processing of NOTCH receptors (Figure 3), especially by the gamma secretase complex. \\u03b3-Secretase (\\u03b3S) is a multifactor complex formed by presenilin 1/2 (homolog PS1 or PS2), nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective 1A/1B (APH-1a or APH-1b), and presenilin enhancer\\u20052 (PEN-2) proteins. Anchored in the cell membrane, \\u03b3S is responsible for the hydrolysis of substrates through the activity of its catalytic subunit, presenilin. The proteolytic cut of the S3 cleavage site of all four NOTCH receptors represents a key event in the activation of canonical Notch signaling [109,110]. Thus, the inhibition of the \\u03b3-secretase complex by \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (\\u03b3SI or GSI) is the most intensely studied and best understood mechanism, and also the most frequently used method to attenuate Notch signaling in pharmacological research and therapy. This is true despite the observation that the \\u03b3-Secretase complex targets approximately 140 different substrates [111] and is involved in the processing of many other proteins beside NOTCH receptors, although this may be the primary function with which this class of compounds is now associated. The initial target for the first GSI, however, was Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), in which the \\u03b3-secretase complex is associated with the deposition of senile plaques, resulting from the aberrant deposition of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the production of short amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b2) [112]. However, GSI have not proven beneficial for the treatment or prophylaxis against AD, and all clinical trials have failed. The first GSI to be used in clinical trials against cancer in the year 2006 was, therefore, a drug repurposed from AD research, MK-0752 [113]. The drug was only partially successful, and the clinical trial overall was a disappointment; MK-0752 was a non-specific, broad-band GSI and showed only limited efficacy in inhibiting T-ALL proliferation. Nevertheless, it resulted in limited disease regression in a small number of patients. Since 2006, many more clinical trials have been conducted with a spectrum of different GSI, most of which have failed, mainly due to high cytotoxicity and/or poor efficacy. Many initial clinical phase 1 studies, aiming to find the optimal and safe drug dosage for patients, have shown excessive toxicity in patients treated with GSI, mainly due to severe gastrointestinal adverse events, often resulting in the discontinuation of these trials. Many patients enrolled in these clinical trials suffered from persistent, severe diarrhea in a dose-dependent manner [114]. The basis for this toxicity remains incompletely understood. It is likely related to the existence of multiple known and validated \\u03b3-secretase substrates in addition to APP or NOTCH1, such as ephrinB2, ERBBP4, E-cadherin, and CD44 [115], which are widely expressed in human tissues,\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3].

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with GPR3 KO mice also decreased A\\u03b2 production, and GPR3 was expressed in the brains of SAD patients92.

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

Unfortunately, little was learned from the failed trials\\u00a0(De Strooper, 2014), and \\u03b3-secretases were largely deprioritized as drug targets for the industry in the context of AD. Interestingly, the capacity of GSIs to block Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999) remained all this time of interest to companies in the context of cancer and chronic inflammation (McCaw et al, 2021; Christopoulos et al, 2021). Nirogacestat (Ogsiveo) recently became the first GSI to reach regulatory approval for rare desmoid tumors that are non-cancerous growths of the connective tissue (Gounder et al, 2023) (see Box\\u00a01). Recent success with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) in AD have considerably changed the perspective on the potential of A\\u03b2 lowering as a possible therapy for this devastating disorder (Karran et al, 2011; Karran and De Strooper, 2022). However, various aspects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy may not make them the optimal therapeutic choice for primary prevention clinical studies. A possible approach to primary prevention might be the suppression of A\\u03b2 production so that the key A\\u03b2 plaque-seeding peptides are not produced in sufficient concentrations to initiate plaque formation. While inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase or of BACE1, the other protease that is needed to release A\\u03b2 from APP (Fig.\\u00a01), remain formal possibilities, both approaches suffer from the same dilemma: can a therapeutic window be established sparing the normal functions of both enzymes? To administer agents that already carry known adverse events to normal individuals lacks clinical equipoise. Gamma-secretase allosteric stabilizers (GSAS), in contrast to \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), theoretically allow normal physiological processing of the many substrates of the \\u03b3-secretases, while enhancing the processive cleavage of the A\\u03b2 peptide, favouring the generation of shorter forms as we will discuss below. The GSASs avoid the mechanism-based side effects that precluded the clinical development of GSIs and revert the production of all long A\\u03b2 peptides to shorter forms, in contrast to the earlier \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSM) that were directed to A\\u03b242 lowering (Weggen et al, 2001; Luo and Li, 2022). In the first part of this review, we will discuss our current understanding of \\u03b3-secretases and the effect of clinical mutations on their activity, resolving ongoing controversy in the field. We will stress how novel insights from cryo-EM structures (Yang et al, 2021) and a better understanding of function\\u00a0(Petit et al, 2022a; Szaruga et al, 2017) and cell biology (Sannerud et al, 2016) of the \\u03b3-secretases have allowed insights into the mode of action of GSASs. In the second part of the review, we will use these insights to explain the mode of action of GSASs and to discuss the roadblocks to further clinical development of GSAS-based precision medicine approaches for the prevention of AD. One of the major aims of the therapeutic development of GSIs in AD was to separate Notch from APP processing. The putative Notch sparing inhibitor avagacestat (Coric et al, 2015) made it to a phase-II clinical trial but was halted because of Notch and other side effects.

      "#### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma secretase is critically located in the cell membrane where it processes amyloid precursor protein (APP). This positioning is directly relevant to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biology, as the cleavage of APP by gamma secretase is a pivotal step in the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is implicated in amyloid plaque formation, a hallmark of AD pathology (Veugelen et al., 2016).\n",

      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression of gamma secretase components, particularly presenilin (PS1 and PS2), can be altered. Mutations in PS1 and PS2 have been linked to familial forms of AD, leading to increased production of the more aggregation-prone Aβ42 (Welander et al., 2009). Additionally, dysregulation of gamma secretase activity has been observed in sporadic AD cases, contributing to altered Aβ peptide profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma secretase is involved in the proteolytic processing of several type I transmembrane proteins beyond APP, including Notch, which is essential for cell signaling and development. However, its role in APP processing is particularly relevant to AD, as the imbalance in Aβ production and clearance leads to neurotoxic accumulation and subsequent neurodegeneration (Veugelen et al., 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Genetic studies have identified several mutations in the genes encoding gamma secretase components (e.g., PSEN1, PSEN2) that are associated with early-onset familial AD. The phenotypes associated with these mutations often include an earlier age of onset and more aggressive disease progression. Additionally, variations in the APOE gene, particularly the ε4 allele, have been linked to altered Aβ metabolism and increased AD risk, indicating a complex interaction with gamma secretase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Genetic Link Between Target and Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma secretase and Alzheimer's disease is well-established, particularly through mutations in the presenilin genes. These mutations lead to altered enzymatic activity, favoring the production of Aβ42 over Aβ40, thus enhancing amyloid plaque formation and contributing to the pathophysiology of AD (Welander et al., 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Evidence from Clinical Studies and Pathway Modulation\n",
      "Clinical evidence supporting the role of gamma secretase in AD includes the observation that gamma secretase inhibitors can reduce Aβ production in vitro and in vivo. However, clinical trials targeting gamma secretase have yielded mixed results, with some showing potential in reducing Aβ levels but also leading to adverse effects due to the inhibition of Notch signaling (Veugelen et al., 2016). This highlights the necessity for careful modulation of gamma secretase activity to achieve therapeutic benefits without significant side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "To effectively treat Alzheimer's disease, a nuanced approach to gamma secretase modulation is required. Strategies may include the development of selective gamma secretase modulators (SGSMs) that preferentially lower Aβ42 production while preserving Notch signaling activity. This selective modulation could help mitigate the neurotoxic effects of Aβ42 accumulation while maintaining the physiological functions of gamma secretase (Veugelen et al., 2016). \n",

We hypothesized that the PSKO phenotype, including the decreased expression of Syt7 results from the absence of AICD because this \\u03b3-secretase product has been reported to regulate transcription31. We performed laser capture microdissection of the GC layer to prepare RNA samples used for qRT-PCR of Syt7 mRNA, and did not observe any change between the two genotypes (Fig.\\u00a05f). We further addressed the possible involvement of AICD in presynaptic mechanisms by testing whether the molecular rescue of AICD in PSKO GCs could recover the functional phenotype. Once again we used a strategy based on the combination of a Cre-expressing lentivirus with a Cre-ON lentivirus (Fig.\\u00a05g and Supplementary\\u00a05a). This allowed the optical control of activity of GCs which were PSKO but still expressed AICD (Fig.\\u00a05h). In this condition, we did not observe any recovery of presynaptic facilitation (Fig.\\u00a05i) while basal transmission was not affected (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a05b,c). The lack of evidence for an impairment at the transcriptional level indicates that Syt7 protein is dysregulated post-transcriptionally. In the absence of PS and its \\u03b3-secretase proteolytic activity, unprocessed substrates APP-CTF\\u03b1/\\u03b2 (APP-CTFs) may accumulate. We studied the expression level of different fragments of APP by staining brain slices with antibodies directed against either the Nterminal or Cterminal epitopes of APP. In control conditions, we observed that the SL was moderately stained with the Cterminal antibody relatively to the CA3 somata and barely stained with the Nterminal antibody (Fig.\\u00a06a). Interestingly, in conditions where PS is selectively suppressed in Mf axons, we observed a striking increase of APP staining with the Cterminal but not with the Nterminal antibody indicating that an APP fragment lacking the Nterminal epitope accumulates in PSKO axons (Fig.\\u00a06a, b). Using protein samples obtained by laser microdissection of PSKO Mfs, we distinctly identified APP-CTFs as the APP fragment accumulating in Mf axons (Fig.\\u00a06c, d). In Mfs, the initial ectodomain shedding of APP is likely performed by BACE1 which is abundantly expressed in these axons (ref. 32 and Supplementary\\u00a06a). In PSKO Mfs, the accumulation of APP-\\u03b2CTF in terminals suggests that it can neither be retrogradely transported nor be catabolized by enzymes other than PS. We induced an accumulation of APP-CTFs in neuronal cultures similar to the one observed in Mfs by blocking PS function with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor (GSI). Interestingly, we observed an inverse correlation between Syt7 expression level and APP-CTFs, which progressively accumulates in protein lysates from cultures treated from 6\\u2009h to 9 days with GSI (Fig.\\u00a06e), suggesting that accumulation of APP-CTFs prevents the normal expression of Syt7.Fig. 6\\u03b3-secretase proteolytic activity regulates the axonal expression of APP-\\u03b2CTF. a Confocal images of the Mfs tracts distinguished in the red channel (ChIEFtom) and of stainings of APP Cterminal with Y188 antibody (upper panel) and Nterminal with JRD32 antibody (lower panel).

While their physiological roles remain incompletely resolved, they have been recognized for their signaling engagements and trafficking abilities, navigating a number of molecules between endosome, Golgi compartments, and the cell surface. Strikingly, recent studies connected all the VPS10p-D receptors to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) development. In addition, they have been also associated with diseases comorbid with AD such as diabetes mellitus and major depressive disorder. This systematic review elaborates on genetic, functional, and mechanistic insights into how dysfunction in VPS10p-D receptors may contribute to AD etiology, AD onset diversity, and AD comorbidities. Starting with their functions in controlling cellular trafficking of amyloid precursor protein and the metabolism of the amyloid beta peptide, we present and exemplify how these receptors, despite being structurally similar, regulate various and distinct cellular events involved in AD. This includes a plethora of signaling crosstalks that impact on neuronal survival, neuronal wiring, neuronal polarity, and synaptic plasticity. Signaling activities of the VPS10p-D receptors are especially linked, but not limited to, the regulation of neuronal fitness and apoptosis via their physical interaction with pro- and mature neurotrophins and their receptors. By compiling the functional versatility of VPS10p-D receptors and their interactions with AD-related pathways, we aim to further propel the AD research towards VPS10p-D receptor family, knowledge that may lead to new diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies for AD patients.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nOver 55 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, which is expected to rise to 78 million by 2030 (World Alzheimer Report 2021). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) accounts for 60\\u201380% of all diagnosed dementia cases [1]. Disturbingly, no efficient treatment is currently available. This unmet medical need is likely a consequence of the complex biology of the disease, which remains poorly understood. AD is clinically characterized by extensive neuronal cell death in the cerebral cortex and limbic system that is manifested by cognitive impairments, memory deficits, disorientation, spatiovisual difficulties, linguistic problems, and emotional imbalances. At the histopathological levels, AD is defined by the accumulation of extracellular Amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) plaques and by the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (pTau) in the brain parenchyma [2]. The A\\u03b2 plaques are considered the pathological hallmark of AD, but synergistic effect of pTau leading to weakening and deterioration of synapses, dystrophic neurites, neuroinflammation, and progressive neuronal cell death is likely involved too [2, 3]. The A\\u03b2 peptide lies within the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Under normal conditions, the nascent APP is\",\n",

This cleavage results in the release of A\\u03b2 monomers into the extracellular space, where they can further polymerize forming A\\u03b2 oligomers, and later A\\u03b2 plaques. This pathway is neurotoxic and is called amyloidogenic pathway The strongest genetic evidence behind AD pathogenesis is linked to familial early-onset AD (EOAD), which accounts for 5\\u201310% of all AD cases. EOAD diagnosis has been mostly associated to autosomal-dominant mutations in three genes that result in increased levels and aggregation of A\\u03b2. They are APP, and APP-cleaving \\u03b3-secretase presenilin components, PSEN1 and PSEN2. However, the majority of patients are diagnosed with sporadic, late-onset AD (LOAD), the heritability of which is estimated to be between 60 and 80% [11, 12]. Hence, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) investigating up to 150,000 AD cases have identified a number of risk genes underscoring the polygenic nature of LOAD [11, 13, 14]. Most recently, a study incorporating more than 100,000 AD cases and almost 700,000 control individuals identified 75 risk loci, of which 42 had not previously been described [14]. Functional annotation of the risk genes indicated that amyloid aggregation, Tau phosphorylation, endocytosis, intracellular vesicle trafficking, altered lipid metabolism, and immune responses are critically involved in the pathogenesis of LOAD [2, 13\\u201318]. Notably, around 40% of LOAD patients carry a disease-associated SNP in the gene encoding Apolipoprotein E (APOE), which exists in 3 polymorphic alleles called E2, E3, and E4. Due to such high incidence, APOE polymorphism is considered the most important genetic risk factor for LOAD [19\\u201321]. ApoE has multiple physiological functions, but it is mostly known for transportation of cholesterol and other lipids through the circulation system as well as within the brain parenchyma. Even though all human ApoE isoforms interact with A\\u03b2, the functional outcome is different [22]. While ApoE2 shows neuroprotective features, ApoE4 represents the major risk factor for AD due to its involvement in A\\u03b2 processing [23]. The possession of ApoE4 allele leads to intracellular accumulation of A\\u03b2 by enhancing the uptake of A\\u03b2 peptides, resulting in the enlargement of endosomal compartments, subsequent endosomal-lysosomal pathway dysregulation, and thus decreased clearance of A\\u03b2 [24]. Several other mechanisms have been described for ApoE4 in relation to AD, including neuronal hyperactivation [25], increased Tau phosphorylation [26], modulation of neuroinflammatory pathways [23], and impaired synaptic plasticity [27]. Such abnormalities, fueled by reduced trophic support, are considered major drivers behind the progression of AD. For this reason, impairments in\",\n",

Despite very limited knowledge about the molecular function of SorCS3, there is substantial evidence for its implications in AD. Similarly to SorCS1 and -2, SorCS3 exhibits spatiotemporal expression during development. In the adulthood, SorCS3 is expressed across the brain, with the highest expression in the CA1 region of hippocampus and in cerebral cortex [121, 122]. SorCS3 mostly localizes at the plasma membrane where it binds its ligands. Using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy at neutral pH, Dong et al. recently suggested that human SorCS3 exists mostly as a dimer since they observed 79% of dimer particles compared to 21% of monomer particles [156]. Interestingly, SorCS3 monomer contained 10CC domain in different orientation than the dimers. They detected three different conformations of the dimers, and suggested that SorCS3 exhibits dynamic conformational changes, which differed from SorLA and SorCS2, especially in the possible ligand-binding features. However, this structural study is still quite preliminary. SorCS3 interacts with its binding partners even prior to its maturation by propeptide cleavage [136]. The SorCS3 cytoplasmic tail is responsible for its intracellular trafficking as it navigates SorCS3 into dendrites and to a lower extent also into axons [122] (Fig.\\u00a08). The major function of SorCS3 is to control synaptic structure and function, via binding of scaffold proteins and controlling glutamate receptor trafficking [354, 355]. However, SorCS3 involvement in neurotrophin signaling has been proposed [136, 144]. In 2013, Reitz et al. described for the first time that SORCS3 is genetically associated to AD (12 SNPs). An epistatic analysis of the AD cohort revealed a strong interaction of SORCS3 mutations with those in SORCS2 (24 SNP pairs) and SORCS1 (8 SNP pairs). These mutations were all located in introns 1 and 2, thus the introns contiguous to the exons encoding the ligand-binding VPS10 domain (similarly to SNPs found in SORCS1 and SORCS2) [84]. Further, a recent whole genome sequence analysis of a multiethnic cohort comprising 11,000 women, found a strong genome-wide significant association between SORCS3 and dementia with an odds-ratio of no less than 4.4. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that SorCS3 expression is indeed substantially decreased in the context of AD [356]. These studies found that SorCS3 is consistently downregulated in AD [84, 357]. Recently, the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium identified SORCS3 as a shared top-risk gene across 8 different psychiatric disorders highlighting the pleiotropic though unclear function of SorCS3 in healthy and diseased human brain [90]. This is interestingly given a GWAS analysis from a Han Chinese cohort of AD patients with major depressive disorder further identified 675 SNPs in SORCS3 gene, thus bridging these two commonly comorbid disorders [358, 359] with one risk factor [90, 360].

These substrates represent a valuable resource that may facilitate the future development of drugs inhibiting or modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity in a substrate-specific manner. Synaptic dysfunction is an early event in AD pathogenesis, leading to cognitive decline. Presenilin mutations disrupt calcium homeostasis, impair neurotransmitter release, and compromise synaptic plasticity [33]. This dysregulation can result from altered store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) mechanisms, which play a critical role in maintaining neuronal function. A study by Cheung et al. [34] demonstrated that mutant presenilin disrupts SOCE, leading to abnormal calcium signaling in neurons. This disruption can trigger excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately neuronal death. Another study has also demonstrated that presenilin interacts with synaptic proteins, including PSD-95, critical for synaptic structure and function [35]. These alterations in synaptic function contribute to memory deficits and cognitive impairment in AD patients. Therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving synaptic integrity by targeting presenilin-related mechanisms hold promise for AD treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that presenilin also plays a role in neuroinflammation, a key feature of AD pathology. Mutant presenilin can activate microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [36,37]. This chronic inflammatory response exacerbates neuronal damage and accelerates disease progression. Targeting presenilin-related neuroinflammation represents a potential avenue for AD therapeutics. AD is characterized not only by A\\u03b2 pathology but also by widespread neuronal network dysfunction. Presenilin mutations have been linked to aberrant network activity in the brain. Research by Palop et al. [38] demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing mutant presenilin exhibit hippocampal hyperexcitability and epileptic seizures, suggesting a role for presenilin in regulating neuronal network activity. These findings underscore the far-reaching consequences of presenilin dysfunction beyond A\\u03b2 production. Neuronal loss is a hallmark of advanced AD. Dysregulated A\\u03b2 production, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction driven by presenilin mutations all contribute to progressive neurodegeneration [39]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying presenilin-mediated neuronal loss is crucial for developing interventions that can preserve neuronal function and slow disease progression. Presenilin\\u2019s involvement in apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is another causative factor for neuronal loss. Dysregulated apoptosis is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Studies have shown that increased sensitivity to apoptosis in neural cells expressing mutant presenilin-1 is linked to perturbed calcium homeostasis and enhanced oxyradical production [40,41,42]. Another study demonstrated that mutant PS-2 not only induced p53 expression but also led to an increase in miR-34a expression. This suggests that mutant PS-2\",\n",

Wnt ligands signaling via Frizzled (Fz) receptors play many crucial roles in neuronal and synaptic development but whether and how Wnt and Fz influence synaptic maturation is incompletely understood. Here we show that Fz2 receptor cleavage via the \\u03b3-secretase complex is required for postsynaptic development and maturation. In the absence of \\u03b3-secretase, Drosophila neuromuscular synapses fail to recruit postsynaptic scaffolding and cytoskeletal proteins, leading to behavioral deficits. Introducing \\u03b3-secretase mutations linked to familial early-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease into flies leads to synaptic maturation phenotypes that are identical to those seen in null alleles. This conserved role for \\u03b3-secretase in synaptic maturation and postsynaptic development highlights the importance of Fz2 cleavage and suggests that receptor processing by proteins linked to neurodegeneration may be a shared mechanism in aspects of synaptic development.  To form the connections underlying thought and memory, synapses in the brain must first mature. Restrepo et al. demonstrate that synaptic maturation in Drosophila requires cleavage of the Wnt receptor Fz2 via \\u03b3-secretase, a proteolytic complex implicated in Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease.

      "        \"original_text\": \", respectively [249, 250]. Increased Tau phosphorylation, its subsequent misfolding and prion-like spreading are common pathological features in AD brains [4]. By using mutant Tau transgenic mice (P301S), prion-propagation assay, and inhibitory antibodies against Sortilin, Johnson et al. found that Sortilin activity suppresses replication of Tau prion in the forebrain thus protecting it against neurotoxic pTau aggregation. On contrary, Sortilin expression is lower in the hindbrain where it does not protect against p-Tau accumulation [223]. AD shares several other mechanisms with Prion diseases, a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders which major genetic component is neuronal Prion protein (PrPC). PrpC is a transmembrane receptor localized in lipid rafts [251] that regulates neuronal excitability and neurite outgrowth [252]. PrPc inhibits BACE1 and Tau expression, which subsequently reduces the levels of A\\u03b2 in the brain [253]. During AD, PrPC converts into its polymerizing, misfolded form called scrapie isoform PrPSc, which binds A\\u03b2O, and transduces their cytotoxic signals across the neuronal membrane [254\\u2013256] causing synaptic failure and cognitive impairments [257\\u2013261]. Upon A\\u03b2O binding, PrPC is phosphorylated by Fyn kinase leading to hyperactivation of NMDAR channels, and subsequent glutamate toxicity. Furthermore, A\\u03b2O-PrPC complex physically binds its co-receptor the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which activates the Fyn kinase, followed by eEF2 phosphorylation, and consequent loss of neuritic spines and memory [262\\u2013264]. At the plasma membrane, PrPC binds A\\u03b2 oligomers with high-affinity, yet during aging, A\\u03b2O-PrP complexes eventually accumulate extracellularly in form of plaques, even before AD manifestation [265]. Thus, targeting receptors involved in A\\u03b2O signal transduction such as PrPC and mGluR5, or disrupting the A\\u03b2O-PrPC complex holds therapeutic potential in AD patients [266]. Indeed, a recent study discovered that a PrPC antagonist blocks the protein aggregation, and rescues the A\\u03b2-related synapse loss and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice [267], similarly to mGluR5 antagonist [262].\\u00a0Strikingly, Uchiyama et al. showed that Sortilin is neuroprotective against the prion spreading as it internalizes PrPC and PrPSc, and transports them into lysosomes for their degradation. However, PrP can be a determinant of Sortilin activity since increased accumulation of cytotoxic PrPSc leads to lysosomal degradation of Sortilin resulting in progressive propagation of PrPSc [268]. Accordingly, Sortilin deficiency leads to early accumulation of PrPSc, and accelerated disease progression and death of the mice. These observations pinpoint the neuroprotective role of Sortilin sorting against protein misfolding and prion-related spreading that might include internalization of other proteins than just Tau and PrP. Along with aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), Tau pathology is also a hallmark of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) [269]. Haploinsufficiency for GRN, a gene encoding progranulin (PGRN) that is a protein with widespread neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory functions, is one possible causative for FTD [270\",\n",

Research on Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) has spurred investigations into therapeutic approaches targeting the \\u03b3-secretase complex, particularly its crucial component, presenilin. Drug development aimed at modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity for AD treatment faces challenges, as the complex is involved in various cellular processes with potential unintended consequences upon inhibition. Several drugs, such as semagacestat and avagacestat, targeting \\u03b3-secretase, underwent clinical trials but were discontinued due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in some patients [113]. Ongoing research seeks to refine \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors for improved safety and efficacy. Alternative strategies focus on mitigating neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction associated with presenilin dysfunction. Anti-inflammatory drugs and immunomodulatory therapies are being explored to counteract neuroinflammation in AD [36]. Efforts to enhance synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission through pharmacological interventions are also underway [114]. Personalized medicine approaches are gaining momentum, recognizing the need for tailored treatments based on specific presenilin mutations. Gene editing technologies have been explored to correct certain presenilin mutations [115]. Recent studies have shown that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology is able to selectively disrupt PSEN1 mutations leading to an autosomal dominant form of early-onset AD and counteract the AD-associated phenotype [116,117]. Despite challenges, targeting the \\u03b3-secretase complex, especially presenilin, remains a therapeutic focus in AD research. Balancing the reduction of amyloid beta production with the preservation of essential \\u03b3-secretase functions poses a significant challenge in AD drug development [118]. Presenilin, initially identified for its role in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), has emerged as a multifunctional protein with diverse roles in cellular physiology and pathology. Beyond its well-known involvement in A\\u03b2 production, presenilin plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling, synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, Notch signaling, autophagy, ER stress, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, blood\\u2013brain barrier integrity, and tau pathology. In addition, we have summarized some recently discovered new functions of presenilin, including trafficking function, regulation of APOE secretion, interaction with ApoE and change of \\u03b3-secretase activity in different APOE genotypes, induction of oxidative damage through ferritin, and alteration of ACE-mediated A\\u03b242-to-A\\u03b240-converting activity. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying presenilin\\u2019s multifaceted roles is crucial for gaining insights into both normal cellular physiology and the pathogenesis of various diseases, including AD. The \\u03b3-secretase complex, with presenilin at its core, serves as critical molecular machinery involved in the processing of multiple transmembrane proteins, including Notch and APP. Dysregulation of \\u03b3-secretase activity due to presenilin mutations disrupts the cleavage of these substrates, leading to profound consequences in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. While challenges remain, ongoing research into presenilin and its associated pathways offers hope for novel therapeutic interventions that can slow or even halt the progression of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

This cleavage leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which aggregate to form amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD pathology (Barthet et al., 2018).

      "\n",
      "**Target Location Relevance to Disease Biology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase (GSEC) is a multi-subunit protease complex that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This cleavage leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which aggregate to form amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD pathology (Barthet et al., 2018). The involvement of GSEC in the amyloidogenic pathway makes it a crucial target for therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing Aβ levels and mitigating synaptic dysfunction associated with AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Altered Target Expression in Human Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of AD, the expression and activity of gamma secretase components, particularly presenilin (PS), are altered. Mutations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to familial forms of AD, leading to dysregulated Aβ production (Yang et al., 2024). Furthermore, studies have shown that the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) occurs in conditions where presenilin function is impaired, indicating a direct relationship between gamma secretase activity and AD pathology (Barthet et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Physiological Processes Relevant to Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase is involved in various physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling. Its cleavage of APP not only generates Aβ but also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which is implicated in transcriptional regulation (Barthet et al., 2018). Dysregulation of these processes due to altered gamma secretase activity can contribute to synaptic dysfunction, a precursor to cognitive decline in AD patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic studies have identified several phenotypes associated with gamma secretase activity. For instance, mutations in presenilin genes are strongly associated with early-onset familial AD, resulting in increased Aβ levels and aggregation (Yang et al., 2024). Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked multiple genetic loci to sporadic late-onset AD, underscoring the polygenic nature of the disease and the role of gamma secretase in its pathogenesis (Salasova et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Genetic Link Between Target and Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma secretase and AD is well-established, particularly through mutations in presenilin genes. These mutations lead to enhanced production of pathogenic Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is more prone to aggregation and plaque formation (Castro et al., 2019). This genetic predisposition highlights the importance of targeting gamma secretase to modulate Aβ levels and potentially alter disease progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence from Clinical Studies and Pathway Tools:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma secretase have faced challenges, such as the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat due to cognitive decline in patients (Yang et al., 2024). However, ongoing research continues to explore more selective inhibitors and modulators that can effectively reduce Aβ production while minimizing off-target effects. Additionally, tools that enhance synaptic plasticity and counteract neuroinflammation are being investigated as potential adjunct therapies in conjunction with gamma secretase modulation (Yang et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Required Target Modulation for Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To effectively treat AD, a nuanced approach to gamma secretase modulation is necessary. This includes the development of selective inhibitors that can reduce Aβ production without compromising the proteolytic functions of gamma secretase essential for normal cellular processes (Yang et al., 2024). Furthermore, personalized medicine strategies, such as gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, are being explored to correct specific presenilin mutations linked to familial AD, offering a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic interventions (Yang et al., 2024).\n",

It is a target for treatment due to its involvement in A\\u03b2 production.

      "        \"original_text\": \") is a drug that reduces the generation of A\\u03b2 by inhibiting \\u03b3 cleavage in the App membrane. The generation of A\\u03b2 requires the cleavage of \\u03b3-secretase, so \\u03b3-secretase is involved in the pathogenesis of AD and is one of the targets for targeting A\\u03b2 treatment (De Strooper and Chavez Gutierrez, 2015). Although some clinical trials have stopped due to lack of clinical efficacy or side effects, animal studies for it are still in progress. Studies have shown that GSI can not only reduce the generation of A\\u03b2, but also significantly reduce the expression of APP (Law et al., 2018). Another study explored the role of flavonols (mulberry and isoquercetin) and flavanones (hesperidin and neohesperidin) as GSIs, inhibiting \\u03b2-sheet aggregation and increasing its ability to decompose, reducing caspase-3 and -9 activity (Carmona et al., 2020). Presenilin is a catalytic component of \\u03b3-secretase. Studies have investigated whether \\u03b3-secretase specificity to substrates in mouse cells expressing human PS1 or PS2 in coordination with PS1 or PS2. As a result, it was found that mouse PS1 plays a major role in \\u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP and Notch as compared with mouse PS2. GSI blocks PS2-\\u03b3 secretase in mice better than PS1-\\u03b3 secretase, while GSI preferentially targets human PS1- but not PS2-dependent \\u03b3-secretase activity (Stanga et al., 2018). Therefore, we should pay attention to these differences when designing GSI and reduce side effects. A study of the causes of failure in the phase III clinical trial of Semagacestat found that some Semagacestat effects were significantly different from those caused by loss of presenilin function. Therefore, Semagacestat may be a pseudo-GSI, and its clinical trials did not really validate the effectiveness of \\u03b3-secretase as a strategy for the treatment of A\\u03b2 (Tagami et al., 2017). Surprisingly, recent in vitro studies have found that low doses of GSI may increase A\\u03b2 generation. Low doses of DAPT (a GSI) increased the generation of several A\\u03b2 peptides, particularly A\\u03b2x\\u201342, and increased A\\u03b2 oligomers were found in cortical neurons treated with low doses of DAPT (Agholme et al., 2017). Other studies have found rebound effects caused by GSI, such as increased levels of PS1 and other \\u03b3-secretase subunits. After the treatment of primary neurons with DAPT or avagacestat (a kind of GSI), the expression of PS1 was significantly increased. After 21 days of taking avagacestat, the expression of PS1 in the brain increased. Long-term taking of avagacestat increased the anxiety-like behaviors in rats (Ono et al., 2012). A large number of studies have shown that oligomers are the most toxic species, but it is not clear whether oligomers can be treated as a selective therapeutic target and be remodeled into non-toxic or low-toxic structures with drugs. At present, there are many researches on drug-targeting oligomers and some progress has been made. Studies on phenolic compounds have found that it can inhibit the oligomerization of A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242, and even the aggregation of A\\u03b2 fibers by binding specific amino acid residues on A\\u03b2 monomers (Ladiwala et al., 2011). Another study evaluated the conformation specificity and remodeling pathways of small aromatic molecules to A\\u03b242 oligomers and classified them into class I,\",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

      "        \"original_text\": \"A). Adjusted according to [193, 195, 201, 203, 256, 338] The APP molecule can be cleaved by three proteases, termed \\u03b1-, \\u03b2-, and \\u03b3-secretases. The \\u03b1-secretase cleaves APP at the PM extracellularly releasing soluble sAPP\\u03b1 and the C-terminal fragment (CTF) C83. This enzyme belongs to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, in which ADAM10 plays a dominant role in APP cleavage [212, 213]. However, only sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP by \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases leads to the formation of potentially deleterious \\u0391\\u03b2 peptide fragments. Intramembrane \\u03b3-secretase processing of C83 generates the nontoxic P3 peptide and cytosolic AICD with regulatory functions in the cell. The amyloidogenic process begins with APP cleavage by \\u03b2-secretase, which generates soluble sAPP\\u03b2 and the membrane-anchored CTF C99. In addition to AICD, sequential \\u03b3-secretase activity releases A\\u03b2 peptides of varying lengths depending on the position and orientation of the enzyme and substrate [175, 214\\u2013216]. The \\u03b2-secretase is known as \\u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), an aspartic protease whose enzymatic activity is highest in the low pH environment of intracellular (i.c.) organelles including the GA and endosomes, where amyloidogenic cleavage predominantly occurs [217\\u2013225]. Together with other members of the amyloidogenic cascade, part of BACE1 is concentrated in cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts [223, 226], and its enzyme activity is enhanced by cerebrosides, anionic lipids, and especially cholesterol [223]. Furthermore, artificial elevation of BACE1 in rafts led to increased A\\u03b2 production, which was reduced after cholesterol depletion, indicating cholesterol regulatory function [54]. The \\u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP was enhanced after endocytosis of APP from the PM, resulting in coalescence of APP and BACE1-containing rafts in endosomes [227]. Besides endosomes, the GA is also associated with A\\u03b2 production. In AD, disruption of GA structure was associated with altered BACE1-APP accumulation in the GA as normal sorting mechanisms failed [228]. The complex of \\u03b3-secretase consists of four subunits: presenilin (PSEN1/2), anterior pharynx defective (APH-1a/b), nicastrin, and the presenilin enhancer (PEN-2) [174, 221, 229, 230]. Whereas PSEN1 is widely distributed in cellular membranes, including the PM, PSEN2 is preferentially localized in the endosomal network and in the GA, where \\u03b3-secretase is localized in lipid rafts [230, 231]. Amyloidogenic processing of C99 by \\u03b3-secretase is concentrated in acidic organelles (mainly endosomes), where A\\u03b2 peptides can accumulate and form neurotoxic aggregates [8, 177, 218, 232\\u2013234]. Nicastrin sterically restricts the binding of APP to \\u03b3-secretase, so that only after cleavage of the e.c.

Flotillin-2, syntaxin-binding protein 1, solute carrier family 2 member 3, and growth-associated protein 43 were also found as \\u03b3-secretase-associated proteins in lipid rafts186. Using a biotinylated GSI, GCB (GSI coupled to biotin via a cleavable linker, L-685,458 derivative), in the brain instead of using overexpressed cell lines identified several endogenous GSMPs. Previously, a yeast two-hybrid screening identified a synaptic plasma membrane protein, syntaxin 1A, which binds to PS1187. Less than 1% of syntaxin 1 associates with endogenous active \\u03b3-secretase complexes in brain membranes159 and brain lipid rafts169. Proton myoinositol cotransporter (SLC2A13) is another endogenous brain GSMP that regulates A\\u03b2 production without affecting Notch processing188. GSI GCB also pulled down several endogenous GSMPs from synapses in the brain, such as NADH dehydrogenase iron-sulfur protein 7 (NDUFS7) from synaptic vesicles and tubulin polymerization promoting protein (TPPP) from synaptic membranes189. Silencing NDUFS7 decreased A\\u03b2 levels, while TPPP increased A\\u03b2 production, and both proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with Nct and PS1-CTF in the human brain189.

Overexpression of MAO-B increased A\\u03b2 production, and MAO-B was associated with active \\u03b3-secretase191. MAO-B levels were increased in neurons of AD human brains191. The treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia, Gleevec (an anticancer drug, imatinib mesylate, STI571), was shown to reduce A\\u03b2 production but spare Notch cleavage192.

Knockdown (KD) of GSAP by siRNA reduced A\\u03b2 production and did not change NICD production, and recombinant GSAP-16 kDa increased A\\u03b2 production63. KD of GSAP by crossing AD X 2 mice with doxycycline-inducible GSAP RNAi mice resulted in the reduction of A\\u03b2 and amyloid plaques in the brain63.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

The study found that mRNA and protein expression levels of A\\u03b242 and APP were significantly elevated in bone cells of osteoporosis patients and rat models, and showed a negative correlation with bone mineral density. A\\u03b242 is mainly located in the cytoplasmic membrane, cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, which can effectively promote osteoclast differentiation and activation, and abnormal deposition of A\\u03b2 occurs in bone tissue. The study concluded that A\\u03b2 may be a candidate biomarker for the identification of osteoporosis drug targets (Li et al., 2014). The current treatment for AD is aimed at clinical symptoms and does not control the progression of the disease. Links of A\\u03b2 metabolism in the brain, plasma and peripheral tissues and possible targets for therapy are shown in Figure 7. Currently, cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists are the only clinically available options. A\\u03b2 plaque is the main pathological feature of AD and is the basis of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. The accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is an important early factor in the pathogenesis of AD, which ultimately leads to neurodegeneration and dementia. At the present stage, designing drugs and treatments based on the type of A\\u03b2 (A\\u03b240 or A\\u03b242) and structural form (fiber, oligomer or monomer) by reducing the generation of A\\u03b2, increasing the clearance of A\\u03b2, or reducing the toxicity of A\\u03b2 is the most important direction for the study of prevention and treatment strategies for AD (Table 1).

BACE1, \\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1; GSI, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor. \\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) is an essential cleavage enzyme in the process of APP to generate A\\u03b2, and inhibition of BACE1 directly affects AD pathological process. Several years ago, a number of different structurally selective BACE1 inhibitors have been designed and entered the clinical evaluation trial phase (De Strooper et al., 2010; Sambamurti et al., 2011; Yan and Vassar, 2014). Two BACE inhibitors have recently been reported to worsen cognitive function during clinical trials. In atabecestat trial, a BACE inhibitor, Henley et al. (2019) found that subjects experienced worse cognitive function and frequent adverse events such as anxiety, sleep, dreams and depression. Egan et al. (2018, 2019) found that verubecestat worsened cognitive function in another drug trial. Although verubecestat found a decrease in A\\u03b2 of CSF and brain in previous tests, it did not find an effect on cognitive function, and found that verubecestat increased the adverse events incidence including anxiety, sleep disorders and depression. For safety, long-term inhibition of this A\\u03b2-producing protease requires the design of more selective drug candidates. Two another BACE inhibitors (elenbecestat and umibecestat) that are still in clinical trials have not been found to cause serious cognitive problems (Selkoe, 2019). The \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor (GSI) is a drug that reduces the generation of A\\u03b2 by inhibiting \\u03b3 cleavage in the App membrane.

In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019). (A) The scheme depicts the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) and p3 peptides. The N-terminal sequence of APPC99 /A\\u03b2 is shown in the lower panel. The differences in the amino acid sequence of human (hu) vs murine (mu) A\\u03b2 peptides and the positions of \\u03b2\\u2019- and \\u03b1-cleavages (that precede the generation of A\\u03b211\\u201342 and p3 17\\u201342 peptides, respectively) are indicated. The transmembrane domain is labeled in grey and the sequence of A\\u03b242 is presented within a rectangle. The initial \\u03b3-secretase endopept\",\n",

Analysis of patients\\u2019 brains shows that these mutations do not result in loss of enzymatic function but in qualitative changes in A\\u03b2 product profiles. Presenilin (PSEN) pathogenic mutations cause familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD [FAD]) in an autosomal-dominant manner. The extent to which the healthy and diseased alleles influence each other to cause neurodegeneration remains unclear. In this study, we assessed \\u03b3-secretase activity in brain samples from 15 nondemented subjects, 22 FAD patients harboring nine different mutations in PSEN1, and 11 sporadic AD (SAD) patients. FAD and control brain samples had similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, and therefore, loss of overall (endopeptidase) \\u03b3-secretase function cannot be an essential part of the pathogenic mechanism. In contrast, impaired carboxypeptidase-like activity (\\u03b3-secretase dysfunction) is a constant feature in all FAD brains. Significantly, we demonstrate that pharmacological activation of the carboxypeptidase-like \\u03b3-secretase activity with \\u03b3-secretase modulators alleviates the mutant PSEN pathogenic effects. Most SAD cases display normal endo- and carboxypeptidase-like \\u03b3-secretase activities. However and interestingly, a few SAD patient samples display \\u03b3-secretase dysfunction, suggesting that \\u03b3-secretase may play a role in some SAD cases. In conclusion, our study highlights qualitative shifts in amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) profiles as the common denominator in FAD and supports a model in which the healthy allele contributes with normal A\\u03b2 products and the diseased allele generates longer aggregation-prone peptides that act as seeds inducing toxic amyloid conformations.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nEarly-onset familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD [FAD]), starting before age 65, is mainly caused by mutations in the Presenilin 1/2 (PSEN1/2) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes and represents less than 0.1% of the total AD cases (Campion et al., 1999).

The analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activity in human brain samples of PS1 FAD cases has shown that AICD formation is not affected whereas the carboxy-terminal processivity defects leading to increase A\\u03b242/40 ratios persist 117. These data strongly suggest that potential effects on the \\\"signaling cleavage\\\" are compensated by the remaining wt PS alleles. A recent study investigating a total of 138 PS1 FAD mutations could not find a correlation with increased A\\u03b242 ratios and the age of onset while the vast majority of the mutants showed strongly reduced total \\u03b3-secretase activity 135. This has been taken as another argument in favor of the presenilin hypothesis. However, the A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 levels and corresponding A\\u03b242/40 ratios of many PS1 FAD mutants that are well-characterized in cell-based assays were not recapitulated well in these assays and the pathogenic A\\u03b243 species had not been measured in the study. Moreover, predicting the age of onset of mutations from \\u03b3-secretase activities measured in cell-free in vitro assays using purified \\u03b3-secretase preparations in which loss of function effects are known to be more strongly pronounced 136 is problematic as this system differs dramatically from the heterozygous situation in FAD patient brain. Importantly, if loss of \\u03b3-secretase activity by presenilin mutations should be causative for AD, then haploinsufficiency of other \\u03b3-secretase subunits should also cause the disease. However, nonsense mutations that have been identified in PS1, NCT and PEN-2 are implicated in the cause of the rare skin disease acne inversa and not AD 137. Finally, it is obvious that all types of APP FAD mutations as well as the protective Icelandic mutation or the presence of AD in Down syndrome patients with an APP gene triplication are not explainable by the presenilin hypothesis. Taken together, balancing the available evidence, the support of the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains overwhelming, whereas the problems of the presenilin hypothesis persist. Since the amyloid cascade hypothesis predicts that lowering A\\u03b2 should be beneficial for AD, \\u03b3-secretase has been an obvious and major drug target. Thus, to inhibit its enzymatic activity and blocking A\\u03b2 generation, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were developed 138139. They fall into two principal classes, transition-state analogue (TSA) inhibitors, such as the prototypic L-685,458 140 and related compounds as well as non-TSA compounds. The former compounds, which target the catalytic site of \\u03b3-secretase were the first highly potent inhibitors identified. Non-TSA inhibitors such as DAPT 141 or LY450139 (semagacestat) 142 are considered to bind nearby the active site. Unfortunately, since such pan-GSIs inhibit both A\\u03b2 and Notch ICD (NICD) production, severe side effects were observed when administered in vivo, mainly due to disturbance of Notch signaling 143144145146. While this is unwanted for AD therapy, treatment of certain cancers may benefit from Notch pathway inhibition by GSIs 147. Several non-TSA GSIs were reported to have less inhibitory effects on NICD generation at a concentration range at which they sufficiently reduce A\\u03b2 secretion.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022).

The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded.

It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch.

Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest.

Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions.

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

Over 100 years ago, Alois Alzheimer described extraneuronal amyloid plaques as a signature pathological characteristic of the disease, and the discovery in the late 1980s and early 1990s that the primary protein component of the plaques is A\\u03b2 [93,94], with A\\u03b242 being the predominant species [13] and most aggregation-prone [95], led to the assumption that A\\u03b242 is the likely pathogenic species. Subsequent studies ranging from effects of APP and presenilin mutations to the neurotoxicity of various A\\u03b2 assemblies would seem to confirm this hypothesis. However, selectivity in the reporting of findings (negative results are more difficult to publish) in combination with incomplete knowledge of all forms of A\\u03b2 could result in mistaking correlation for causality. In light of more recent findings, mentioned earlier, that FAD mutations in PSEN1 increase A\\u03b2 peptide intermediates of 45 residues and longer, it would seem worthwhile to determine the effects of GSMs on the first or second trimming events of APP substrate by \\u03b3-secretase (e.g., A\\u03b249\\u219246, A\\u03b245\\u219242). The devastation of AD is severe, the numbers afflicted are large, and the need for effective therapeutics is great. Despite decades of intense efforts by laboratories around the world, in academia, government, and industry, only symptomatic treatments for AD are available, and no drugs of any kind have been approved since 2003. The large majority of clinical trials have involved agents that target A\\u03b2 in some way, to block its production or aggregation or to stimulate its clearance. \\u03b3-Secretase remains a top target, especially as altered processing of APP substrate by this protease complex is clearly involved in the pathogenesis of FAD. Dominant missense mutations in presenilins\\u2014the catalytic component of the \\u03b3-secretase complex\\u2014and APP\\u2014the \\u03b3-secretase substrate precursor to A\\u03b2\\u2014cause FAD with virtually 100% penetrance. A single mutant allele in either the enzyme or substrate that produce A\\u03b2 fates the carrier to AD in midlife. The pathology, presentation, and progression of this genetic form of the disease is essentially indistinguishable from the much more common form that strikes in late life. Thus, it seems likely that A\\u03b2 in some form similarly plays a key role in the etiology of sporadic late-onset AD. Given the close similarities between the familial and sporadic forms of the disease, elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of the former\\u2014a simpler problem\\u2014is likely to be illuminating for the latter. Early work had focused on the aggregation-prone A\\u03b242, as this A\\u03b2 variant is the principal component of the characteristic cerebral plaques of AD. In many cases, FAD mutations can elevate the ratio of A\\u03b242 to the more soluble A\\u03b240. However, processing of APP substrate by \\u03b3-secretase is complex, involving carboxypeptidase trimming of initially formed A\\u03b248 or A\\u03b249, and FAD mutations can elevate longer forms of A\\u03b2 that contain most of the APP TMD and remain membrane-bound. A critical question is whether these long A\\u03b2 peptides play an important role in the pathogenic process. A variety of substrate-based probes for \\u03b3-secretase have been developed. Transition-state analog inhibitors (TSAs) provided the first clue that the enzyme is an aspartyl protease, and affinity labeling reagents based on TSAs\",\n",

Cerebral neurodegeneration typically takes place first in the hippocampus, a region below the neocortex that is critical for consolidating long-term memories. Neuronal loss spreads to other cortical areas, leading to progressive cognitive decline. By the end stages of the disease, patients lose cognitive function to the point of requiring constant care, often institutionalized. Although a number of risk factors have been associated with AD, disease onset correlates best with age, and the large majority of cases occur in the elderly. Among people over age 85, over a third are afflicted. Two types of protein deposits are found in the AD brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2]. The former are extraneuronal and primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), whereas the latter are intraneuronal filaments of the normally microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuroinflammation is a third pathological feature of AD, in which microglia\\u2014phagocytic brain immune cells that release cytokines\\u2014become overactivated [3]. The role of each of these features in AD etiology and pathogenesis are not well understood. However, A\\u03b2 aggregation\\u2014in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques\\u2014is generally observed as the earliest pathology, followed by tau tangle formation and neurodegeneration [4]. For this reason and those mentioned in the next section, pathological A\\u03b2 is widely considered the initiator of AD, triggering downstream tau pathology and neuroinflammation, and A\\u03b2 has been the primary target for the development of AD therapeutics for over 25 years [5]. As mentioned above, the \\u201camyloid hypothesis\\u201d of AD pathogenesis has reigned for decades, and AD drug development has largely focused on inhibiting A\\u03b2\",\n",

Instead, FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause qualitative shifts in the A\\u03b2 profile, increasing levels of A\\u03b242 and longer peptides like A\\u03b243, A\\u03b245, and A\\u03b246. This study directly investigates \\u03b3-secretase activity in postmortem human brains from familial AD (FAD) patients to evaluate the effects of mutant PSEN1 on \\u03b3-secretase function.\\n\\n8\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \"). Accordingly, Potter et al. (2013) suggest that increments in A\\u03b242 play a decisive pathogenic role in AD. In contrast, a \\u201crevised\\u201d loss-of-function (LOF) hypothesis has recently been proposed by Xia et al. (2015). In this view, loss of PSEN/\\u03b3-secretase physiological cell signaling function causes neurodegeneration, whereas changes in A\\u03b2 peptides are only secondary byproducts that arise from but do not trigger the disease (Xia et al., 2015). The idea is only tenable if FAD-linked PSEN mutations exert a LOF effect on PSEN/\\u03b3-secretase and, in addition, a dominant-negative effect on the healthy PSEN allele (normal \\u03b3-secretase) in patients, a key part of this hypothesis (Heilig et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2015). However, it should be stressed that \\u03b3-secretase haploinsufficiency caused by nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations in genes coding for essential subunits of \\u03b3-secretase (Nct, Pen2, and PSEN) is pathogenic in nature; such haploinsufficiency causes a chronic inflammatory disease of hair follicles known as familial acne inversa. Most importantly, no clinical association between this disorder and AD has been reported (for a review see Pink et al. [2013]). Furthermore, if FAD-linked PSEN mutations were truly LOF mutations, resulting in \\u201cinactive\\u201d \\u03b3-secretase complexes, homozygous individuals for the disease allele would not be viable because of disturbances in Notch signaling during embryonic development. However, six individuals with homozygous PSEN1 E280A gene mutation have been identified (Kosik et al., 2015). An alternative view to both hypotheses is that pathogenic mutations in PSEN cause disease by qualitative shifts in A\\u03b2 profile production (\\u03b3-secretase dysfunction; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012). We have demonstrated that loss of endopeptidase activity is not necessarily observed in \\u03b3-secretase complexes containing PSEN1/2 FAD-linked mutations, but reduced carboxypeptidase-like efficiency (\\u03b3-secretase dysfunction) is the constant denominator. Furthermore, FAD PSEN mutations may affect the carboxypeptidase-like \\u03b3-secretase activity at multiple turnovers, resulting in increased A\\u03b243 and A\\u03b242 levels as well as in other longer A\\u03b2 peptides, such as A\\u03b245 and A\\u03b246 (Quintero-Monzon et al., 2011; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Fernandez et al., 2014). These data support a model in which relative, rather than absolute, changes in A\\u03b2 product profiles are at the basis of PSEN/\\u03b3-secretase\\u2013mediated pathogenicity. However, these findings were based on studies conducted in PSEN1/2-deficient MEFs, which does not fully recapitulate the in vivo heterozygous situation in the FAD patient\\u2019s brain. In the current study, we investigated processing of APP by the \\u03b3-secretase complex in postmortem human brain samples from FAD and SAD patients and healthy control subjects. Our investigation is the first to directly assess \\u03b3-secretase activity in brain material from FAD mutant carriers and to address how the FAD-linked mutant heterozygous situation in patients affects \\u03b3-secretase function in brain. We aimed to evaluate the effects of pathogenic PSEN1 mutants on total \\u03b3-secretase activity (healthy and disease PSEN1 alleles) in human brain samples from FAD patients. As a first step, we sought to determine and contrast the production rates of A\\u03b2 peptides in (a) human control brains, i.e., containing two healthy P\",\n",

The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3.

The trials were halted due to increased risks of skin cancer and infections linked to disrupted Notch signaling. In contrast, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs), like flurbiprofen, showed potential to promote shorter A\\u03b2 species without increasing APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) or affecting Notch signaling, suggesting a safer therapeutic avenue.\\n\\n8\": {\n",

Interestingly, mutations in PS1 change the localization toward that of PS2-containing complexes (67). After the discovery of \\u03b3-secretase, a huge amount of research was carried out to develop potent and bioavailable \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), but the clinical trials based on these inhibitors all failed (Table\\u00a01). Indeed, none of them led to improvement of AD-linked cognitive decline and even sometimes they worsened them. In most of these trials, A\\u03b2 levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly decreased, thus clearly indicating that a reduction in total A\\u03b2 was not sufficient to restore cognitive function. This was the case for Semagacestat, the first GSI tested in late-stage clinical trials for AD, which was reported to reduce A\\u03b2 levels by more than 60% in the plasma (110), and new A\\u03b2 synthesis was decreased by more than 80% in CSF (111). More alarming, many trials were readily stopped because of increased risk of developing skin cancer and infections, which was supposed to be tightly linked to a defective Notch signaling in the presence of the inhibitors (112). Therefore, several groups started to screen for drugs having a higher affinity for APP than toward Notch, such as Avagacestat, initially reported to be 140-fold more selective for APP than Notch (113), although its Notch sparing ability remains controversial (114, 115). Avagacestat led to a 40% A\\u03b2 reduction in CSF (Table\\u00a01), but demonstrated similar side effects in clinical trials (116). Therefore, due to the huge number of different \\u03b3-secretase substrates, it has appeared difficult to target specifically and exclusively the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated APP cleavage. Furthermore, data from preclinical trials proposed that the lack of efficacy, or even worsening, of cognitive function in these trials was also linked to the progressive accumulation of APP-CTFs in the presence of GSIs (117). To avoid such effects, therapeutic development became focused on \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that were expected to be safer, since they interact with \\u03b3-secretase complex through the allosteric binding site, thereby modifying the enzyme activity but not blocking it (118). The concept of \\u03b3-secretase modulation was discovered with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, which are considered as GSMs, because they induce conformational changes in PS1 and shift the cleavage of C99 toward shorter A\\u03b2 species such as A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 (16, 119). In that way, GSMs do not lead to increased APP-CTFs levels. Indeed, in AD animal models, the chronic treatment with GSMs did not lead to the worsening of cognitive function observed with GSIs (117). Moreover, GSMs are also safer because they reduce the level of A\\u03b242 and increase shorter A\\u03b2 peptides without affecting Notch signaling (120, 121). Nonetheless, the first GSMs tested in clinical trials, Rofecoxib (122), Tarenflurbil (123) or Naproxen (124), did not show efficacy, but the lack of effects seemed to be related to a very poor blood\\u2013brain barrier crossing ability of these drugs (Table\\u00a01). Thus, taken together, \\u03b3-secretase-based strategies have so far been unsuccessful, even if GSMs seem to be more promising (125). Still, if considering \\u03b3\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Inversely, the Icelandic mutation (A673T) seems to be protective against AD by decreasing \\u03b2-secretase cleavage and thus reducing by 40% the amyloidogenic fragments sAPP\\u03b2 and A\\u03b2 (17, 39). The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50).

A recent study investigating a total of 138 PS1 FAD mutations could not find a correlation with increased A\\u03b242 ratios and the age of onset while the vast majority of the mutants showed strongly reduced total \\u03b3-secretase activity 135. This has been taken as another argument in favor of the presenilin hypothesis. However, the A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 levels and corresponding A\\u03b242/40 ratios of many PS1 FAD mutants that are well-characterized in cell-based assays were not recapitulated well in these assays and the pathogenic A\\u03b243 species had not been measured in the study. Moreover, predicting the age of onset of mutations from \\u03b3-secretase activities measured in cell-free in vitro assays using purified \\u03b3-secretase preparations in which loss of function effects are known to be more strongly pronounced 136 is problematic as this system differs dramatically from the heterozygous situation in FAD patient brain. Importantly, if loss of \\u03b3-secretase activity by presenilin mutations should be causative for AD, then haploinsufficiency of other \\u03b3-secretase subunits should also cause the disease. However, nonsense mutations that have been identified in PS1, NCT and PEN-2 are implicated in the cause of the rare skin disease acne inversa and not AD 137. Finally, it is obvious that all types of APP FAD mutations as well as the protective Icelandic mutation or the presence of AD in Down syndrome patients with an APP gene triplication are not explainable by the presenilin hypothesis. Taken together, balancing the available evidence, the support of the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains overwhelming, whereas the problems of the presenilin hypothesis persist. Since the amyloid cascade hypothesis predicts that lowering A\\u03b2 should be beneficial for AD, \\u03b3-secretase has been an obvious and major drug target. Thus, to inhibit its enzymatic activity and blocking A\\u03b2 generation, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were developed 138139. They fall into two principal classes, transition-state analogue (TSA) inhibitors, such as the prototypic L-685,458 140 and related compounds as well as non-TSA compounds. The former compounds, which target the catalytic site of \\u03b3-secretase were the first highly potent inhibitors identified. Non-TSA inhibitors such as DAPT 141 or LY450139 (semagacestat) 142 are considered to bind nearby the active site. Unfortunately, since such pan-GSIs inhibit both A\\u03b2 and Notch ICD (NICD) production, severe side effects were observed when administered in vivo, mainly due to disturbance of Notch signaling 143144145146. While this is unwanted for AD therapy, treatment of certain cancers may benefit from Notch pathway inhibition by GSIs 147. Several non-TSA GSIs were reported to have less inhibitory effects on NICD generation at a concentration range at which they sufficiently reduce A\\u03b2 secretion. Such Notch-sparing GSIs, as for example the promising candidate BMS-708163 (avagacestat) 148, were thus considered as improved\",\n",

Thus, a rapid generation and deposition of A\\u03b2 in stroke and after head trauma, which could benefit to maintain the BBB integrity and inhibit the leakage of serum components into the brain, leading to neuroinflammation.436 \\u03b3-secretase has dozens of substrates. Previous clinical trials of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have failed, in large part due to the toxicity induced by lack of substrate-specific inhibition. Particularly notable is toxicity resulting from inhibition of Notch-1 cleavage, which disrupts essential signaling from this receptor.15,313 Thus, we should discover compounds that act as substrate-selective \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, which block the cleavage of C99, the immediate precursor of A\\u03b2, while allowing Notch cleavage to proceed unimpeded. Recently, a study showed that verteporfin only bound with the APP transmembrane domain rather than the transmembrane domain of the Notch-1 receptor, indicating its inhibitory effect is in a C99-specific manner.437 Our study also showed that PSEN1S169del (a deletion mutation in PSEN1 gene exon 6) has distinct effects on APP processing and Notch1 cleavage.39 This AD pathogenic mutation altered APP processing and A\\u03b2 generation without affecting Notch-1 cleavage and Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo. The results indicate that serine169 in PS1 could be a critical site as a potential target for the development of novel \\u03b3-secretase modulators without affecting Notch-1 cleavage to treat AD. A lack of selectivity is also a significant barrier to the therapeutic application of BACE1 inhibitors in AD. For instance, BACE2 is a close homolog of BACE1 but plays a neuroprotective role by inhibiting the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing7,8,10 and reducing potassium channel Kv2.1-induced neuronal apoptosis.438 Thus, a non-selective BACE1 inhibitor also inhibits BACE2\\u2019s protective functions, leading to off target side effects. Although the aspartyl protease family (e.g. BACE2, pepsin, renin, cathepsin D and cathepsin E) has conserved catalytic aspartic acid residues, the subsites in the active sites may be unique.439 Targeting these subsites to develop BACE1 inhibitors may increase their specificity. A\\u03b2-targeting antibodies also show off-target effects. A recent study identified that antibodies with Fc fragment reduced A\\u03b2 burden but also induced the engulgment of neuronal synapses by activating complement receptor 3 (CR3) or Fc\\u03b3 receptor IIB (Fc\\u03b3RIIB), which exacerbates cognitive impairment in AD mice.440 AD can be classified into a genetic and sporadic form of the disease.441 More than 99% of AD cases occur at an age >60 years in a sporadic manner, potentiated by various risk factors related to lifestyle.442 Less than 1% of all AD cases are early-onset with symptoms developed at an age of 50\\u2009s and earlier, and caused by gene mutations in APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2.7\",\n",

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) is triggering the disease. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavages of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. The latter cleavage by \\u03b3-secretase, a unique and fascinating four-component protease complex, occurs in the APP transmembrane domain thereby releasing A\\u03b2 species of 37-43 amino acids in length including the longer, highly pathogenic peptides A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243. The lack of a precise understanding of A\\u03b2 generation as well as of the functions of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key AD drug target in the past few years. Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the \\u03b3-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes \\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP into different A\\u03b2 species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of A\\u03b242/43. Finally, we discuss how the knowledge emerging from these studies could be used to therapeutically target this enzyme in a safe way.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u00b4s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide currently affecting about 47 millions people. The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3. A\\u03b2 is a small hydrophobic ~4 kDa peptide, which is derived by sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a single pass transmembrane protein with type I topology which is expressed in neurons\",\n",

      "**Target Location Relevance to Disease Biology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase (GSEC) is a multi-subunit protease complex that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This cleavage leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which aggregate to form amyloid plaques—a hallmark of AD pathology (Szaruga et al., 2015; Steiner et al., 2018). Elevated levels of Aβ42 contribute to neurotoxicity by impairing GSEC activity, which is crucial for APP processing (Hur, 2022; De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The involvement of GSEC in the amyloidogenic pathway makes it a crucial target for therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing Aβ levels and mitigating synaptic dysfunction associated with AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Altered Target Expression in Human Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of AD, the expression and activity of gamma secretase components, particularly presenilin (PS), are altered. Mutations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to familial forms of AD, leading to dysregulated Aβ production (Szaruga et al., 2015; Hur, 2022). Furthermore, studies have shown that the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) occurs in conditions where presenilin function is impaired, indicating a direct relationship between gamma secretase activity and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018; De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Physiological Processes Relevant to Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase is involved in various physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling. Its cleavage of APP not only generates Aβ but also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which is implicated in transcriptional regulation (Szaruga et al., 2015). Dysregulation of these processes due to altered gamma secretase activity can contribute to synaptic dysfunction, a precursor to cognitive decline in AD patients (Hur, 2022; De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic studies have identified several phenotypes associated with gamma secretase activity. For instance, mutations in presenilin genes are strongly associated with early-onset familial AD, resulting in increased Aβ levels and aggregation (Szaruga et al., 2015; Wolfe, 2021). Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked multiple genetic loci to sporadic late-onset AD, underscoring the polygenic nature of the disease and the role of gamma secretase in its pathogenesis (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Genetic Link Between Target and Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma secretase and AD is well-established, particularly through mutations in presenilin genes. These mutations lead to enhanced production of pathogenic Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is more prone to aggregation and plaque formation (Steiner et al., 2018; De Strooper and Karran, 2024). This genetic predisposition highlights the importance of targeting gamma secretase to modulate Aβ levels and potentially alter disease progression (Wolfe, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence from Clinical Studies and Pathway Tools:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma secretase have faced challenges, such as the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat due to cognitive decline in patients (Hur, 2022). However, ongoing research continues to explore more selective inhibitors and modulators that can effectively reduce Aβ production while minimizing off-target effects. Additionally, tools that enhance synaptic plasticity and counteract neuroinflammation are being investigated as potential adjunct therapies in conjunction with gamma secretase modulation (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \" The loss of essential PSEN1 (and PSEN2) functions may result in AD-related neurodegeneration. Several PSEN1 mutations (Gly209Arg, Gly209Val, Leu235Pro, Cys410Tyr, Leu435Phe) may not significantly impact the A\\u03b242 levels (or even reduce it), but they may reduce (or abrogate) the A\\u03b240 production significantly. Pathogenic PSEN1 mutations may impair the \\u03b3-secretase functions through dominant-negative mechanisms. Elevated amyloid levels may also inhibit further the \\u03b3-secretase functions. Loss of PSEN activity may result in abnormalities in synaptic functions, leading to neuronal loss, Tau hyperphosphorylation and dementia. Further studies are also needed on the PSEN hypothesis. For example, APP mutations may not inhibit \\u03b3-secretase related pathways. Additionally, not all PSEN1 mutations could result in a Tau-related pathology [40,283,291]. Besides amyloid and PSEN hypothesis, other AD-hypotheses were also described, such as the Tau hypothesis, the inflammation hypothesis, and the cholinergic and oxidative stress hypothesis, confirming that AD is a very complex disease. There is no absolute hypothesis available on AD progression, but all possible hypotheses could provide an explanation for AD progression and help drug development [282,291,292]. As mentioned before, PSEN1 mutations may impair \\u03b3-secretase mechanisms, resulting in impaired amyloid production and elevated long amyloid/short amyloid (typically A\\u03b242/40) ratio [6]. Furthermore, PSEN1 could affect other mechanisms, such as calcium homeostasis or Notch signaling [6]. Compared to APP- and PSEN2-related cases, EOAD patients with PSEN1 mutations may have an earlier disease onset [293]. Additionally, in the case of APP mutations, memory decline is the initial symptom, whereas PSEN1 mutations may lead to atypical phenotypes, such as seizures or motor-behavioral or language dysfunctions. The mutation location may impact the PSEN1 phenotype. With regard to the atypical symptoms in cases of PSEN1 mutations, the location of the mutation may be important. Mutations located in the N-terminal region (before codon 200) may more frequently represent myoclonus, seizures, visuospatial symptoms, or spasticity. Meanwhile, among patients who carry mutations in the C-terminal area (after codon 200), cotton wool plaques and amyloid antipathy may be relatively common [292]. Brain imaging has revealed that APP mutations may result in a higher degree of hippocampal atrophy. PSEN1 mutations may also affect other brain areas such as the neocortex or white matter [77]. The phenotypic diversity of PSEN1 mutations may also be related to its involvement in \\u03b3-secretase function. PSEN1 impacts the formation of the \\u03b3-secretase catalytic subunit, and in addition to APP processing, it could impact multiple substrate cleavage (\\u03b2-catenin, Notch). PSEN1 mutations can affect endopeptidase and carboxylpeptidase activities, which may result in different types of neurodegenerative process [284,294]. Interestingly, patients with the same PSEN1 mutations may have different ages of onset or clinical course. For example, EOAD with PSEN1 Thr119Ile has been discovered in multiple patients with a wide age range of ages of disease onset (between 49 and 71 years); some cases developed memory decline only, while in others, personality changes and psychological symptoms were present. It is possible that other genetic factors may impact disease onset and clinical course, for example, variants in\",\n",

Early-onset familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is caused in part by pathogenic variants in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), and alternative splicing of these two genes has been implicated in both familial and sporadic Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Here, we leveraged targeted isoform-sequencing to characterize thousands of complete PSEN1 and PSEN2 transcripts in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with sporadic Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (carrying PSEN1 and PSEN2 variants), and controls. Our results reveal alternative splicing patterns of PSEN2 specific to sporadic Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, including a human-specific cryptic exon present in intron 9 of PSEN2 as well as a 77 bp intron retention product before exon 6 that are both significantly elevated in sporadic Alzheimer\\u2019s disease samples, alongside a significantly lower percentage of canonical full-length PSEN2 transcripts versus familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease samples and controls. Both alternatively spliced products are predicted to generate a prematurely truncated PSEN2 protein and were corroborated in an independent cerebellum RNA-sequencing dataset. In addition, our data in PSEN variant carriers is consistent with the hypothesis that PSEN1 and PSEN2 variants need to produce full-length but variant proteins to contribute to the onset of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, although intriguingly there were far fewer full-length transcripts carrying pathogenic alleles versus wild-type alleles in PSEN2 variant carriers. Finally, we identify frequent RNA editing at Alu elements present in an extended 3\\u2032 untranslated region in PSEN2. Overall, this work expands the understanding of PSEN1 and PSEN2 variants in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, shows that transcript differences in PSEN2 may play a role in sporadic Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and suggests novel mechanisms of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathogenesis.

PSEN1 mutations affect gamma-secretase activity, leading to changes in amyloid peptide production, notably decreasing short amyloids like A\\u03b240 and altering the ratio of short to long amyloids, which can serve as a disease marker.

Besides A\\u03b240, other short amyloids, such as A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b237, may also be reduced in the case of PSEN1 mutations (e.g., PSEN1 Ala97Val or Val89Leu). Reduced levels of short amyloids may also be a marker of lower amyloid trimming activity and reduced \\u03b3-secretase processivity. Furthermore, the reduced ratio of combined short amyloids vs. combined long amyloids ((A\\u03b238 + A\\u03b237 + A\\u03b240)/(A\\u03b242 + A\\u03b243)) may be a useful marker of disease pathogenicity [73,281]. PSEN1 has been identified as the most common causative gene for early onset AD. To date, more than 300 mutations have been reported in PSEN1 that potentially play a role in neurodegenerative pathways. Most PSEN1 mutations are heterozygous and follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. However, homozygous forms of PSEN1 mutations, such as Ala431Glu or Glu280Ala, have also been observed. The homozygous forms of PSEN1 mutations may be associated with a more aggressive disease phenotype than the heterozygous mutations [262]. A compound heterozygous case of PSEN1 was also discovered, wherein the patient carried a STOP codon mutation at residue Ser357 and the Arg377Trp mutation. However, it remains unclear whether these two mutations affect disease onset [225]. PSEN1 mutations could result in neurodegeneration through both gain-of-function [282] or loss-of-function mechanisms [283]. Hardy and Higgins (1992) proposed the amyloid hypothesis, suggesting that the accumulated amyloid peptides may be the main causative factors for AD related neurodegeneration. Additionally, mutant PSEN1 mutations (such as Met84Val, Leu85Pro, His163Arg, His163Pro, Met233Leu) could enhance the APP processing and amyloid peptide (A\\u03b242) generation. However, this study also raised concerns about the amyloid hypothesis. For example, amyloid plaques in the brain may not correlate with the degree of neurodegeneration. Additionally, amyloid production in cell cultures may not correlate with the age of onset or disease phenotypes [40,282,284,285,286]. Later, the amyloid hypothesis was refuted further. It was revealed that elevated A\\u03b242 may not be the only factor leading to PSEN1-related neurodegeneration. For example, PSEN1 mutations may result in earlier disease onset, compared to mutations in APP, even though A\\u03b242/40 ratio may not be as significant as expected [286]. Additionally, amyloid overproduction did not result in significant neurodegeneration in mouse models [285,286,287]. These findings suggest that the loss of PSEN1 functions may play a crucial role in AD progression. PSEN knockout mice presented a significant degree of neurodegeneration; however, the level of both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 was reduced. PSEN knockout could result in an elevated degree of neuroinflammation, reduced neuroprotection and an increased degree of apoptosis [288,289,290]. Shen and Kelleher (2007) proposed the presenilin hypothesis of AD, which may provide an alternative view of disease pathogenesis. The loss of essential PSEN1 (and PSEN2) functions may result in AD-related neurodegeneration. Several PSEN1 mutations (Gly209Arg, Gly209Val, Leu235Pro, Cys410T\",\n",

We provide here a structural basis for the first approach and hope that this will stimulate further research into that direction. However, other work from our laboratory has suggested that even further selective inhibition, targeting only the PSEN1\\u2013Aph1B complexes, would be particularly beneficial in the prevention of AD (21). While we found some indications in the current work that selectivity between PSEN1\\u2013APH1A and PSEN1\\u2013APH1B can be achieved, this aim remains rather elusive, and further high-resolution structures including the determination of Aph1B versus Aph1A differences would help in this regard. In conclusion, with the proof that A\\u03b2 therapeutics have a place in the fight against AD (51) and the observations in the current and other studies that selective inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase (18, 20) is possible and preclinical evidence that this is a more safer way forward (7, 17, 19, 21), further efforts to develop drugs that target specifically PSEN1\\u2013APH1B \\u03b3-secretase complexes seem an important goal for new therapeutic development. Small compounds that act selectively and more safely could become a cheap and more broadly available alternative than the expensive passive immunization approaches that are currently propagated and have shown success in the fight against AD (51).

Primary MEFs were immortalized by transduction with LargeT antigen. Psen1/2 double KO/Aph1ABC triple KO MEFs were generated by transduction with a Cre-GFP\\u2013expressing adenoviral vector, and GFP-positive MEFs were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Psen1/2 Aph1ABC-deficient MEFs were maintained in DMEM/f12 10% FCS.

An Internal Ribosome Entry Site sequence was cloned between the coding sequences for PSEN and APH1 to ensure co-expression of both proteins.

EOAD is usually characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern; however, autosomal recessive inheritance may also be possible [5]. Three genes have been identified as causative factors for EOAD: amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, presenilin-1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14, and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1 [4]. These mutations are rare, as only 1% of patients carry APP mutations, 6% of patients carry PSEN1 mutations, and less than 1% of patients carry PSEN2 mutations [4]. Mutations in PSEN1 have been identified as the most common causative factor for EOAD, and patients with these mutations may present with a rapidly progressive disease [4,6]. To date, more than 300 mutations have been identified in PSEN1 [https://www.alzforum.org/mutations/psen-1, accessed on 1 July 2022]. In this review, we discuss the functions of PSEN1 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and its possible impact on other diseases. Additionally, we introduce PSEN1 mutations with their clinical phenotypes and the functional studies performed on these mutations. The PSEN1 protein contains 467 amino acids and shows 65% homology to the PSEN2 protein. PSEN1 is a transmembrane protein with nine transmembrane domains connected to hydrophilic loops in either the extracellular area or the cytosol. The N-terminal fragment and the large hydrophilic loop are located in the cytosol region, while the C-terminal fragment is located in the extracellular space. The large hydrophilic loop also contains a membrane-associated area. PSEN1 is a member of the \\u03b3-secretase complex that plays a key role in APP processing and amyloid peptide generation [7]. PSEN1 contains two catalytic aspartic acids (Asp275 and Asp 385, located on TM6 and TM7, respectively), that play key roles in both PSEN1 endoproteolytic activity and \\u03b3-secretase activity [8]. Additional critical residues were found in TM, located between positions 95 and 98. Mutations in these residues can inhibit or abolish PSEN1 proteolysis and \\u03b3-secretase activity [9]. An additional important residue could be Asp345, which is located in the loop between TM6 and TM7. A caspase cleavage site was located next to this amino acid, which plays a crucial role in the interaction between PSEN1 and its binding partners [8]. As part of the \\u03b3-secretase complex, PSEN1 or PSEN2 forms a complex with nicastrin (Nct), PSEN enhancer 2 (PEN2), and anterior pharynx 1 (APH-1). Furthermore, the \\u03b3-secretase complex is known to interact with various other proteins, including ubiquitin, protein-folding related proteins or adhesion molecules [10]. PSEN1 is involved in the C-terminal transmembrane region of APP and the production of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b242) by \\u03b3-secretase, after APP processing \\u03b1-and \\u03b2-secretases. PSEN1 may not be an enzyme itself, but a crucial regulator protein in \\u03b3-secretase cleavage. PSEN1 could also play a role in the transport of C-terminal APP fragment to the gamma secretase complex. A deficiency in PSEN1 function may impair APP processing, resulting\",\n",

Their role in AD is of particular interest because dominant inherited mutations in the catalytic subunits (presenilin (PSEN)1 and PSEN2) of these enzymes are sufficient to cause the full neuropathological and clinical spectrum of this brain disorder. Indiscriminate inhibition of all the \\u03b3-secretases with \\u201cbroad\\u201d spectrum \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) causes, however, severe mechanism-based side effects.

However, besides Notch and Amyloid beta Precursor Protein (APP), more than a hundred other substrates for \\u03b3-secretases have been identified (12), making it difficult to interpret the side effects only in terms of Notch inhibition. It seems crucial to develop more targeted and specific approaches to modulate these enzymatic activities.

PSEN1 is a part of \\u03b3-secretase, and in addition to amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, it can also affect other processes, such as Notch signaling, \\u03b2-cadherin processing, and calcium metabolism. Several motifs and residues have been identified in PSEN1, which may play a significant role in \\u03b3-secretase mechanisms, such as the WNF, GxGD, and PALP motifs. More than 300 mutations have been described in PSEN1; however, the clinical phenotypes related to these mutations may be diverse. In addition to classical EOAD, patients with PSEN1 mutations regularly present with atypical phenotypic symptoms, such as spasticity, seizures, and visual impairment. In vivo and in vitro studies were performed to verify the effect of PSEN1 mutations on EOAD. The pathogenic nature of PSEN1 mutations can be categorized according to the ACMG-AMP guidelines; however, some mutations could not be categorized because they were detected only in a single case, and their presence could not be confirmed in family members. Genetic modifiers, therefore, may play a critical role in the age of disease onset and clinical phenotypes of PSEN1 mutations. This review introduces the role of PSEN1 in \\u03b3-secretase, the clinical phenotypes related to its mutations, and possible significant residues of the protein.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nNeurodegenerative dementia is classified as a major health issue, with more than 50 million people around the world affected by some form of dementia. Most affected patients (almost two-thirds) are diagnosed with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), followed by frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and vascular dementia [1]. AD is an irreversible and progressive form of dementia associated with the loss of memory and cognitive function. Age has been verified as the strongest risk factor for AD, as disease prevalence increases with age. The number of patients with AD increases rapidly after 65\\u201370 years of age [2]. AD has different neuropathological hallmarks, including extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and the loss of neurons and synapses. Additional atypical neuropathological phenotypes, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), cotton wool plaques, Lewy bodies or Pick\\u2019s bodies may also co-occur in patients with AD [3]. Although the majority of cases are associated with the late-onset form of the disease, several cases develop a disease phenotype at a younger age. Early-onset AD (EOAD) represents 1\\u20135% of all AD cases and can occur under 65 years of age. The majority of patients present with disease phenotypes in their 40s or 50s, but disease onset at a young age (in their 20s and 30s) is also possible [4]. EOAD is usually characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern; however,\",\n",

It notes that \\\"the majority of PSEN1 mutations result in an elevated A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio,\\\" indicating increased A\\u03b242 or reduced A\\u03b240 production. The \\u03b3-secretase activity, responsible for the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is central to these mutations, as alterations in this pathway can produce toxic peptides like A\\u03b243.

These findings reveal that mutations, which also present spastic paraparesis as a disease phenotype, may have large effects on amyloid production. However, this study did not rule out the potential roles of other genetic and environmental risk modifiers [61]. Kumar-Singh et al. (2006) co-introduced eight PSEN1 mutations with Swedish APP mutations (Lys670Asn and Met671Leu) into HEK293 cell lines using plasmid methods. This study revealed a strong correlation between age at disease onset and an elevated A\\u03b242/40 ratio, higher A\\u03b242, and lower A\\u03b240 levels [48]. Sun et al. (2017) performed an extensive functional study on 138 PSEN1 mutations and used the CRISPR-Cas9 transfection method to generate N2a mutant cell lines. This study did not find a correlation between the A\\u03b242/40 ratio and the age at disease onset. The majority of mutant cells showed reduced levels of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, and approximately 10% of the mutations were related to the A\\u03b242/40 ratio. This study suggests that the amyloid hypothesis may not be the only hypothesis in the case of AD onset, and other risk factors should be examined [94]. Hsu et al. used N2a cell lines to verify several VUS in EOAD-causing genes, including PSEN1. This study identified 19 mutations (11 PSEN1 mutations) as probable pathogenic variants [39]. Li et al. (2016) analyzed several PSEN1 mutations in HEK293 cell lines, revealing that in addition to the A\\u03b242/40 ratio, the cleavage of A\\u03b243 to A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b240 may be reduced in the case of PSEN1 mutations. Some PSEN1 mutations could affect the A\\u03b242/40 ratio through the A\\u03b249/A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b248/38 ratios, whereas some mutations could only affect one of them [166]. The majority of PSEN1 mutations result in an elevated A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio by elevating A\\u03b242 production or reducing A\\u03b240 production. Increased levels of A\\u03b242 and/or reduced levels of short A\\u03b240 in cell and animal models may provide strong proof of the pathogenic nature of the mutation [273]. In addition to A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, other products may reflect the altered \\u03b3-secretase process. APP processing may be initiated by \\u03b2-secretase cleavage, which results in the release of the N-terminal region of the protein. The membrane-bound remnant of APP, called C99, is processed by \\u03b3-secretase. This process could result in long amyloid peptides with endopeptidase activity (43\\u201351 bp), which could be cleaved to A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 through carboxypeptidase activity [279]. Few mutations may reduce the endo- or carboxypeptidase activity of \\u03b3-secretase, resulting in the generation of long amyloid peptides, including A\\u03b243, A\\u03b246, or A\\u03b248 [280]. A\\u03b243 has also been suggested to act as a toxic peptide, generated regularly by PSEN1 mutations, such as Val261Phe or Arg278Ile. Production of A\\u03b243 may be a useful marker, indicating the relation between the mutation and the impaired endopeptidase activity [184]. Besides A\\u03b240, other short amyloids, such as A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b237, may also be reduced in the case\",\n",

However, for some PSEN1 mutations, subtle changes in the use of the initial endoproteolytic cleavage site might induce more frequent processing of the APP substrate in the A\\u03b242 generating product line contributing to an increase in the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio, which is supported by mutagenesis studies indicating changes in the molecular interaction of PSEN1 mutants with the APP substrate (25, 41, 42). The reduced carboxypeptidase processivity of PSEN1 mutants resulting in a larger proportion of aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 peptides has been regarded as a gain-of-function mechanism. Alternatively, the occurrence of PSEN1 missense mutations throughout the coding region without apparent mutational hot spots could be indicative of a loss-of-function mechanism. Furthermore, to explain the autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern associated with heterozygous PSEN1 missense mutations, it has been proposed that PSEN1 mutants are dominant-negative and function as antimorphs in trans by interacting with and obstructing the function of the wild-type protein expressed from the second PSEN1 allele (43, 44, 45, 46). Support for this so-called presenilin hypothesis was drawn from several experimental observations including the age-dependent neurodegeneration and memory impairments in conditional PSEN1/PSEN2 double knockout mice (47, 48), the drastically reduced enzyme activity of some PSEN1 mutants when assessed in overexpression or homozygous knock-in models (32, 40, 49, 50, 51), and the large size of \\u03b3-secretase complexes observed in early purification attempts consistent with oligomerization of its subunits (52, 53, 54). By transient co-transfection into PSEN-deficient cells, evidence was provided that mutant PSEN1 could perturb the enzymatic activity and A\\u03b242 generation of wild-type PSEN1 through direct physical interaction, and it was proposed that mutant PSEN1 might allosterically alter the conformation of wild-type PSEN1 (55). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that co-incubation of purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes containing wild-type PSEN1 with complexes containing mutant PSEN1 reduced A\\u03b2 generation, supporting a dominant-negative effect on enzyme activity through hetero-oligomerization. Moreover, in the presence of different detergents, the proteolytic activity of purified \\u03b3-secretase was correlated with its oligomerization (56). In addition, using super-resolution microscopy, a recent study reported that a substantial fraction of \\u03b3-secretase in the plasma membrane appeared to be dimeric (57). However, other biochemical and structural studies have provided definitive evidence that the four subunits of the \\u03b3-secretase complex are present in a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry and could not demonstrate an interaction between wild-type and mutant PSEN1 by co-immunoprecipitation (12, 17, 58). These controversial results might in part be related to the predominant use of experimental models that did not accurately resemble the heterozygous genetic background in patients with eFAD in which the mutant PSEN1 allele is expressed in the context of one wild-type PSEN1 and two wild-type PSEN2 alleles. In this study, using genome engineering, we have generated a panel of isogenic murine embryonic stem (ES) cell lines and derived neural stem cells (NSCs) with a heterozygous expression of eFAD P\",\n",

Heterozygous mutations in the PSEN1 gene cause early-onset familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (eFAD) and increase the proportion of longer aggregation-prone amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243). Previous studies had suggested that PSEN1 mutants might act in a dominant-negative fashion by functional impediment of wild-type PSEN1, but the exact mechanism by which PSEN1 mutants promote pathogenic A\\u03b2 production remains controversial. Using dual recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (dRMCE), here we generated a panel of isogenic embryonic and neural stem cell lines with heterozygous, endogenous expression of PSEN1 mutations. When catalytically inactive PSEN1 was expressed alongside the wild-type protein, we found the mutant accumulated as a full-length protein, indicating that endoproteolytic cleavage occurred strictly as an intramolecular event. Heterozygous expression of eFAD-causing PSEN1 mutants increased the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio. In contrast, catalytically inactive PSEN1 mutants were still incorporated into the \\u03b3-secretase complex but failed to change the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio. Finally, interaction and enzyme activity assays demonstrated the binding of mutant PSEN1 to other \\u03b3-secretase subunits, but no interaction between mutant and wild-type PSEN1 was observed. These results establish that pathogenic A\\u03b2 production is an intrinsic property of PSEN1 mutants and strongly argue against a dominant-negative effect in which PSEN1 mutants would compromise the catalytic activity of wild-type PSEN1 through conformational effects.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nThe aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides in the brain is believed to be the initial trigger in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), the most common cause of clinical dementia (1).

      "Gamma secretase (GSEC) is a multi-subunit protease complex that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This cleavage leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which aggregate to form amyloid plaques—a hallmark of AD pathology (Szaruga et al., 2015; Steiner et al., 2018). Elevated levels of Aβ42 contribute to neurotoxicity by impairing GSEC activity, which is crucial for APP processing (Hur, 2022; De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The involvement of GSEC in the amyloidogenic pathway makes it a crucial target for therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing Aβ levels and mitigating synaptic dysfunction associated with AD.\n",

Since cleavages of C99 and Notch1 are kinetically extremely slow with very low turnover numbers kcat\\n76110, it is likely that conformational flexibility of the substrate, in particular TMD helix dynamics, plays an important role to find the conformations that allow productive accommodation into the enzyme at the exosites and/or the active site 111112.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1.

Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli.

In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

The analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activity in human brain samples of PS1 FAD cases has shown that AICD formation is not affected whereas the carboxy-terminal processivity defects leading to increase A\\u03b242/40 ratios persist 117. These data strongly suggest that potential effects on the \\\"signaling cleavage\\\" are compensated by the remaining wt PS alleles. A recent study investigating a total of 138 PS1 FAD mutations could not find a correlation with increased A\\u03b242 ratios and the age of onset while the vast majority of the mutants showed strongly reduced total \\u03b3-secretase activity 135. This has been taken as another argument in favor of the presenilin hypothesis. However, the A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 levels and corresponding A\\u03b242/40 ratios of many PS1 FAD mutants that are well-characterized in cell-based assays were not recapitulated well in these assays and the pathogenic A\\u03b243 species had not been measured in the study. Moreover, predicting the age of onset of mutations from \\u03b3-secretase activities measured in cell-free in vitro assays using purified \\u03b3-secretase preparations in which loss of function effects are known to be more strongly pronounced 136 is problematic as this system differs dramatically from the heterozygous situation in FAD patient brain. Importantly, if loss of \\u03b3-secretase activity by presenilin mutations should be causative for AD, then haploinsufficiency of other \\u03b3-secretase subunits should also cause the disease. However, nonsense mutations that have been identified in PS1, NCT and PEN-2 are implicated in the cause of the rare skin disease acne inversa and not AD 137. Finally, it is obvious that all types of APP FAD mutations as well as the protective Icelandic mutation or the presence of AD in Down syndrome patients with an APP gene triplication are not explainable by the presenilin hypothesis. Taken together, balancing the available evidence, the support of the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains overwhelming, whereas the problems of the presenilin hypothesis persist. Since the amyloid cascade hypothesis predicts that lowering A\\u03b2 should be beneficial for AD, \\u03b3-secretase has been an obvious and major drug target. Thus, to inhibit its enzymatic activity and blocking A\\u03b2 generation, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were developed 138139. They fall into two principal classes, transition-state analogue (TSA) inhibitors, such as the prototypic L-685,458 140 and related compounds as well as non-TSA compounds. The former compounds, which target the catalytic site of \\u03b3-secretase were the first highly potent inhibitors identified. Non-TSA inhibitors such as DAPT 141 or LY450139 (semagacestat) 142 are considered to bind nearby the active site. Unfortunately, since such pan-GSIs inhibit both A\\u03b2 and Notch ICD (NICD) production, severe side effects were observed when administered in vivo, mainly due to disturbance of Notch signaling 143144145146. While this is unwanted for AD therapy, treatment of certain cancers may benefit from Notch pathway inhibition by GSIs 147. Several non-TSA GSIs were reported to have less inhibitory effects on NICD generation at a concentration range at which they sufficiently reduce A\\u03b2 secretion.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50).

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

The lack of a precise understanding of A\\u03b2 generation as well as of the functions of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key AD drug target in the past few years. Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the \\u03b3-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes \\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP into different A\\u03b2 species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of A\\u03b242/43.

The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3. A\\u03b2 is a small hydrophobic ~4 kDa peptide, which is derived by sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a single pass transmembrane protein with type I topology which is expressed in neurons\",\n",

      "**Target Location Relevance to Disease Biology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase (GSEC) is a multi-subunit protease complex that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This cleavage leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which aggregate to form amyloid plaques—a hallmark of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Elevated levels of Aβ42 contribute to neurotoxicity by impairing GSEC activity, which is crucial for APP processing (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The involvement of GSEC in the amyloidogenic pathway makes it a crucial target for therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing Aβ levels and mitigating synaptic dysfunction associated with AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Altered Target Expression in Human Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of AD, the expression and activity of gamma secretase components, particularly presenilin (PS), are altered. Mutations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to familial forms of AD, leading to dysregulated Aβ production (Szaruga et al., 2015). Studies indicate that PSEN1 mutations can significantly reduce Aβ40 production while not necessarily affecting Aβ42 levels, thus altering the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio critical for disease pathology (Bagaria et al., 2022). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) occurs in conditions where presenilin function is impaired, indicating a direct relationship between gamma secretase activity and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018; De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Physiological Processes Relevant to Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase is involved in various physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling. Its cleavage of APP not only generates Aβ but also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which is implicated in transcriptional regulation (Steiner et al., 2018). Dysregulation of these processes due to altered gamma secretase activity can contribute to synaptic dysfunction, a precursor to cognitive decline in AD patients (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). Additionally, the presenilin hypothesis suggests that PSEN1 mutations may lead to gain-of-function mechanisms that enhance Aβ production, further complicating the disease's progression (Kurth et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic studies have identified several phenotypes associated with gamma secretase activity. For instance, mutations in presenilin genes are strongly associated with early-onset familial AD, resulting in increased Aβ levels and aggregation (Szaruga et al., 2015; Wolfe, 2021). The phenotypic diversity of PSEN1 mutations can yield various clinical outcomes, with some mutations leading to atypical symptoms (Bagaria et al., 2022). Additionally, variations in the APOE gene, particularly the ε4 allele, have been linked to altered Aβ metabolism and increased AD risk, indicating a complex interaction with gamma secretase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Genetic Link Between Target and Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma secretase and AD is well-established, particularly through mutations in presenilin genes. These mutations lead to altered enzymatic activity, favoring the production of Aβ42 over Aβ40, thus enhancing amyloid plaque formation and contributing to the pathophysiology of AD (Welander et al., 2009). This genetic predisposition highlights the importance of targeting gamma secretase to modulate Aβ levels and potentially alter disease progression (Wolfe, 2021). Furthermore, the presenilin hypothesis posits that PSEN1 mutations could act as dominant-negative antimorphs, obstructing the function of wild-type PSEN1 (Kurth et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence from Clinical Studies and Pathway Tools:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma secretase have faced challenges, such as the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat due to cognitive decline in patients (Hur, 2022). However, ongoing research continues to explore more selective inhibitors and modulators that can effectively reduce Aβ production while minimizing off-target effects. The study by Course et al. (2023) highlights the role of aberrant splicing patterns of PSEN2 in sporadic AD, suggesting that transcript differences in PSEN2 may also contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Additionally, tools that enhance synaptic plasticity and counteract neuroinflammation are being investigated as potential adjunct therapies in conjunction with gamma secretase modulation (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Required Target Modulation for Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To effectively treat AD, a nuanced approach to gamma secretase modulation is necessary. This includes the development of selective inhibitors that can reduce Aβ production without compromising the proteolytic functions of gamma secretase essential for normal cellular processes (Wolfe, 2021). The selective inhibition of specific gamma secretase complexes, particularly those containing PSEN1, may provide a safer therapeutic window with fewer side effects (Serneels et al., 2023). Furthermore, personalized medicine strategies, such as gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, are being explored to correct specific presenilin mutations linked to familial AD, offering a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic interventions (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

VDAC1, Erlin-1, and Erlin-2 were previously shown to interact with PS157. Flotillin-2, syntaxin-binding protein 1, solute carrier family 2 member 3, and growth-associated protein 43 were also found as \\u03b3-secretase-associated proteins in lipid rafts186. Using a biotinylated GSI, GCB (GSI coupled to biotin via a cleavable linker, L-685,458 derivative), in the brain instead of using overexpressed cell lines identified several endogenous GSMPs. Previously, a yeast two-hybrid screening identified a synaptic plasma membrane protein, syntaxin 1A, which binds to PS1187. Less than 1% of syntaxin 1 associates with endogenous active \\u03b3-secretase complexes in brain membranes159 and brain lipid rafts169. Proton myoinositol cotransporter (SLC2A13) is another endogenous brain GSMP that regulates A\\u03b2 production without affecting Notch processing188. GSI GCB also pulled down several endogenous GSMPs from synapses in the brain, such as NADH dehydrogenase iron-sulfur protein 7 (NDUFS7) from synaptic vesicles and tubulin polymerization promoting protein (TPPP) from synaptic membranes189. Silencing NDUFS7 decreased A\\u03b2 levels, while TPPP increased A\\u03b2 production, and both proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with Nct and PS1-CTF in the human brain189. Previously, it was shown that monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is increased in AD brains and platelets190. Overexpression of MAO-B increased A\\u03b2 production, and MAO-B was associated with active \\u03b3-secretase191. MAO-B levels were increased in neurons of AD human brains191. The treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia, Gleevec (an anticancer drug, imatinib mesylate, STI571), was shown to reduce A\\u03b2 production but spare Notch cleavage192. A biotinylated derivative of imatinib identified GSAP (\\u03b3-secretase activating proteins)-16\\u2009kDa, and GSAP is the C-terminal region of an uncharacterized protein, pigeon homologue protein (PION)63. GSAP-16 kDa, \\u03b3-secretase, and APP-CTF form a tertiary complex63. Knockdown (KD) of GSAP by siRNA reduced A\\u03b2 production and did not change NICD production, and recombinant GSAP-16 kDa increased A\\u03b2 production63. KD of GSAP by crossing AD X 2 mice with doxycycline-inducible GSAP RNAi mice resulted in the reduction of A\\u03b2 and amyloid plaques in the brain63.

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92.

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

The first endopeptidase cleavage (\\u025b-cleavage) can occur at two distinct sites leading to the generation of A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249, which is then shortened by sequential carboxypeptidase cleavages (trimming) at \\u03b6, \\u03b3-and \\u03b3\\u2032-sites, occurring at each three or four residues and via two distinct product lines (A\\u03b249 > A\\u03b246 > A\\u03b243 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b237) or (A\\u03b248 > A\\u03b245 > A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b238) and the final occurrence of peptides of varying lengths but two major species of 40 or 42 amino acid residues, respectively (51).

For instance, Semagacestat led to a greater than 60% reduction in plasma A\\u03b2 levels but worsened cognitive function. Additionally, adverse effects like increased risk of skin cancer were linked to impaired Notch signaling.

Interestingly, mutations in PS1 change the localization toward that of PS2-containing complexes (67). After the discovery of \\u03b3-secretase, a huge amount of research was carried out to develop potent and bioavailable \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), but the clinical trials based on these inhibitors all failed (Table\\u00a01). Indeed, none of them led to improvement of AD-linked cognitive decline and even sometimes they worsened them. In most of these trials, A\\u03b2 levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly decreased, thus clearly indicating that a reduction in total A\\u03b2 was not sufficient to restore cognitive function. This was the case for Semagacestat, the first GSI tested in late-stage clinical trials for AD, which was reported to reduce A\\u03b2 levels by more than 60% in the plasma (110), and new A\\u03b2 synthesis was decreased by more than 80% in CSF (111). More alarming, many trials were readily stopped because of increased risk of developing skin cancer and infections, which was supposed to be tightly linked to a defective Notch signaling in the presence of the inhibitors (112). Therefore, several groups started to screen for drugs having a higher affinity for APP than toward Notch, such as Avagacestat, initially reported to be 140-fold more selective for APP than Notch (113), although its Notch sparing ability remains controversial (114, 115). Avagacestat led to a 40% A\\u03b2 reduction in CSF (Table\\u00a01), but demonstrated similar side effects in clinical trials (116). Therefore, due to the huge number of different \\u03b3-secretase substrates, it has appeared difficult to target specifically and exclusively the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated APP cleavage. Furthermore, data from preclinical trials proposed that the lack of efficacy, or even worsening, of cognitive function in these trials was also linked to the progressive accumulation of APP-CTFs in the presence of GSIs (117). To avoid such effects, therapeutic development became focused on \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that were expected to be safer, since they interact with \\u03b3-secretase complex through the allosteric binding site, thereby modifying the enzyme activity but not blocking it (118). The concept of \\u03b3-secretase modulation was discovered with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, which are considered as GSMs, because they induce conformational changes in PS1 and shift the cleavage of C99 toward shorter A\\u03b2 species such as A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 (16, 119). In that way, GSMs do not lead to increased APP-CTFs levels. Indeed, in AD animal models, the chronic treatment with GSMs did not lead to the worsening of cognitive function observed with GSIs (117). Moreover, GSMs are also safer because they reduce the level of A\\u03b242 and increase shorter A\\u03b2 peptides without affecting Notch signaling (120, 121). Nonetheless, the first GSMs tested in clinical trials, Rofecoxib (122), Tarenflurbil (123) or Naproxen (124), did not show efficacy, but the lack of effects seemed to be related to a very poor blood\\u2013brain barrier crossing ability of these drugs (Table\\u00a01). Thus, taken together, \\u03b3-secretase-based strategies have so far been unsuccessful, even if GSMs seem to be more promising (125). Still, if considering \\u03b3\",\n",

We analyze the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate using multiscale molecular dynamics studies. We found that an increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate could result in the parallel binding of different substrate molecules at the docking site and the active site. The C-terminal domain of the substrate bound at the docking site can interact with the most dynamic presenilin sites at the cytosolic end of the active site tunnel. Such interactions can inhibit the ongoing catalytic activity and increase the production of the longer, more hydrophobic, and more toxic A\\u03b2 proteins. Similar disruptions in dynamic presenilin structures can be observed with different drugs and disease-causing mutations. Both, C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and its different A\\u03b2 products, can support the toxic aggregation. The aggregation depends on the substrate N-terminal domain. Thus, the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b2-secretase path can be more toxic than the C83-\\u03b1CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b1-secretase path. Nicastrin can control the toxic aggregation in the closed conformation. The binding of the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate to \\u03b3-secretase can be controlled by substrate channeling between the nicastrin and \\u03b2-secretase.

Alzheimer\\u2019s disease stands out among other malignant diseases as imposing the greatest financial burden on healthcare providers in developed countries [1,3,4]. Impressive drug development efforts have been mostly centered on the metabolism of the last 99 amino acids of the amyloid precursor protein (C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP) [3,4].

The presented two-substrate mechanism can explain how disruptions in the optimal balance between \\u03b3-secretase activity and A\\u03b2 metabolism can lead to toxic events in all different sporadic and FAD cases of the disease (Figure 9). A well-defined molecular mechanism that can connect different causes of the disease is crucial for the development of effective early diagnostic tools and drugs [19]. Drug development studies were among the first to indicate that \\u03b3-secretase has two substrate-binding sites [8,9,12,17,30]. Here, we show that the second substrate can affect the sites that bind different drugs (Supplementary Video S3). Such results are consistent with previous studies showing that a gradual increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate can affect how \\u03b3-secretase responds to drugs [6,7,9,11,12]. Drugs can lead to increases in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate [9,89]. Drugs, just like increasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase, can affect the A\\u03b2 (x-42)/A\\u03b2 (x-40) ratio [11,13]. FAD mutations can affect how drugs bind to \\u03b3-secretase [7,10]. Drugs, FAD mutations, and the second substrate can affect the most dynamic parts in the presenilin structure that control processive catalysis (Supplementary Videos S3 and S4). The presented insights indicate that the first possible improvement in future drug development strategies could be the development of competitive inhibitors of \\u03b3-secretase [19]. These competitive inhibitors could mimic the effects of the protective A673T mutation, i.e., decreasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate [15,19]. Attempts to design competitive inhibitors that target the active site have been challenging. The attempts to target the active site with peptide analogs have been unsuccessful due to the surprisingly long and flexible active site tunnel [8,9,12,23]. Our results indicate three alternative strategies for the development of competitive inhibitors: First, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to facilitate the closure of the nicastrin ectodomain (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). Second, the competitive inhibitors could compete with the formation of \\u03b2-secretase\\u2013\\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 8). Third, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules and control its dimerization ([33,34,37] and Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 7). The development of compounds that target C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules is extremely difficult [39]. C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP has a highly dynamic structure and, thus, represents a poorly defined target for effective drug development efforts (Figure 1 and Figure 2 [33,34,37]). The prepared drugs have to compete with other molecules that bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP with high affinity ([37] and Figure 1C). The second major improvement in drug development strategies could be an expansion of the future target list. Compounds that can decrease the catalytic capacity of \\u03b3-secretase can be used to trace different physiological processes that control \\u03b3-secretase activity and amyloid metabolism at pre-symptomatic stages of the disease (Figure 9). Briefly, compounds such as semagacestat and avagacestat can be used in healthy animals to gradually induce pathogenesis, by provoking gradual saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate (Figure 9 [7,9]).

Therefore, these GSIs are nonselective and inhibit both APP and Notch121,124,126. Avagacestat was reported as a \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI and was shown to have a higher selectivity for APP over Notch cleavage127. However, avagacestat was suggested to be nonselective later based on poor Notch-sparing activity122,128 and its binding site as PS1-NTF128. Another \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI, begacestat (GSI-953, Wyeth/Pfizer), was also discontinued in phase I clinical trial, and the reasons are unclear129.

Instead of inhibiting the whole \\u03b3-secretase activity, modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity by \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) has been tested. GSMs are more attractive disease-modifying agents than GSIs because GSMs (1) inhibit selectively aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 production, (2) increase shorter A\\u03b237 or A\\u03b238 species, (3) do not affect the total A\\u03b2 production and the accumulation of APP-CTF, and (4) spare Notch processing132. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and sulindac sulfide, were found to modulate \\u03b3-secretase and represent first-generation GSMs (NSAID-derived carboxylic acid GSMs)132. These NSAIDs lowered A\\u03b242 and increased A\\u03b238 without affecting Notch cleavage133.

A membrane-bound truncated form of Notch, Notch\\u0394E substrate, is further cleaved by \\u03b3-secretase at the S3 site (S3 cleavage) and releases N\\u03b2 and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD is translocated to the nucleus to regulate transcription genes such as Hes and Hey. Notch ligands (ex.

A membrane-bound truncated form of Notch, Notch\\u0394E substrate, is further cleaved by \\u03b3-secretase at the S3 site (S3 cleavage) and releases N\\u03b2 and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD is translocated to the nucleus to regulate transcription genes such as Hes and Hey. The common feature of PSEN1 or PSEN2 FAD mutations is the increased A\\u03b242/40 ratio. However, it has been debated whether it is due to a gain or loss of PS function that results in an increased A\\u03b242/40 ratio113. An A\\u03b242/40 ratio increase could be due to increased A\\u03b242 production, decreased A\\u03b240 production, or a combination of both111. Analysis of the formation of substrate CTFs, ICDs, and A\\u03b2 species as the effect of FAD mutations of PSEN1 or PSEN2 on the cleavage of various \\u03b3-secretase substrates, such as APP, Notch, syndecan-3, N-cadherin, and \\u03b21-integrin, showed that different mutations had a varying effect on substrate processing, indicating \\u201cvariable\\u201d or \\u201cpartial\\u201d loss of PS protein function, and PS2 was less efficient than PS1111. Reconstitution of the PS protein from 138 PS1 FAD mutations with Aph-1aL containing \\u03b3-secretase mostly decreased the production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, increased the A\\u03b242/40 ratio, and suggested the loss of PS1 function114. However, these 138 PS1 FAD mutations also showed that different mutations displayed variations in A\\u03b242 or A\\u03b240 production (increase or decrease)114. In addition, further studies addressing the effect of PS FAD mutations on the structure of \\u03b3-secretase and how those conformational changes could affect the cleavage of different substrates by \\u03b3-secretase remain to be investigated. For instance, E280 in PS1 forms hydrogen bonds with Y159 and Y154102. PS1 E280A (the Columbian mutation) disrupts hydrogen bonds and causes a local conformational change102. Over the years, small molecule inhibitors and modulators targeting \\u03b3-secretase have been developed as potential disease-modifying agents in AD. The main goal is to target \\u03b3-secretase and reduce toxic A\\u03b242 species while sparing other substrate cleavage processing by \\u03b3-secretase. GSIs bind to the active site of PS and inhibit \\u03b3-secretase cleavage, thereby reducing total A\\u03b2 production. GSIs such as L-685,45835,115, BrA-1-Bt34, III-31C116, DAPT117, and Merck C57 as well as GSI-based chemical probes have been widely used to study \\u03b3-secretase.

      "### Clinical Target Rationale for Gamma Secretase in Alzheimer's Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "**Target Location Relevance to Disease Biology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase (GSEC) is a multi-subunit protease complex that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This cleavage leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which aggregate to form amyloid plaques—a hallmark of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Elevated levels of Aβ42 contribute to neurotoxicity by impairing GSEC activity, which is crucial for APP processing (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The involvement of GSEC in the amyloidogenic pathway makes it a crucial target for therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing Aβ levels and mitigating synaptic dysfunction associated with AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Altered Target Expression in Human Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of AD, the expression and activity of gamma secretase components, particularly presenilin (PS), are altered. Mutations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to familial forms of AD, leading to dysregulated Aβ production (Szaruga et al., 2015). Studies indicate that PSEN1 mutations can significantly reduce Aβ40 production while not necessarily affecting Aβ42 levels, thus altering the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio critical for disease pathology (Bagaria et al., 2022). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) occurs in conditions where presenilin function is impaired, indicating a direct relationship between gamma secretase activity and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018; De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Physiological Processes Relevant to Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase is involved in various physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling. Its cleavage of APP not only generates Aβ but also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which is implicated in transcriptional regulation (Steiner et al., 2018). Dysregulation of these processes due to altered gamma secretase activity can contribute to synaptic dysfunction, a precursor to cognitive decline in AD patients (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). Additionally, the presenilin hypothesis suggests that PSEN1 mutations may lead to gain-of-function mechanisms that enhance Aβ production, further complicating the disease's progression (Kurth et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic studies have identified several phenotypes associated with gamma secretase activity. For instance, mutations in presenilin genes are strongly associated with early-onset familial AD, resulting in increased Aβ levels and aggregation (Szaruga et al., 2015; Wolfe, 2021). The phenotypic diversity of PSEN1 mutations can yield various clinical outcomes, with some mutations leading to atypical symptoms (Bagaria et al., 2022). Additionally, variations in the APOE gene, particularly the ε4 allele, have been linked to altered Aβ metabolism and increased AD risk, indicating a complex interaction with gamma secretase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Genetic Link Between Target and Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma secretase and AD is well-established, particularly through mutations in presenilin genes. These mutations lead to altered enzymatic activity, favoring the production of Aβ42 over Aβ40, thus enhancing amyloid plaque formation and contributing to the pathophysiology of AD (Welander et al., 2009). This genetic predisposition highlights the importance of targeting gamma secretase to modulate Aβ levels and potentially alter disease progression (Wolfe, 2021). Furthermore, the presenilin hypothesis posits that PSEN1 mutations could act as dominant-negative antimorphs, obstructing the function of wild-type PSEN1 (Kurth et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence from Clinical Studies and Pathway Tools:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma secretase have faced challenges, such as the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat due to cognitive decline in patients (Hur, 2022). However, ongoing research continues to explore more selective inhibitors and modulators that can effectively reduce Aβ production while minimizing off-target effects. The study by Course et al. (2023) highlights the role of aberrant splicing patterns of PSEN2 in sporadic AD, suggesting that transcript differences in PSEN2 may also contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Additionally, tools that enhance synaptic plasticity and counteract neuroinflammation are being investigated as potential adjunct therapies in conjunction with gamma secretase modulation (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",

We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced.

The GSAS represent, in theory, a precision medicine approach to the prevention of amyloid deposition, as they specifically target a discrete aspect in a complex cell biological signalling mechanism that initiates the pathological processes leading to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex.

Cerebral neurodegeneration typically takes place first in the hippocampus, a region below the neocortex that is critical for consolidating long-term memories. Neuronal loss spreads to other cortical areas, leading to progressive cognitive decline. By the end stages of the disease, patients lose cognitive function to the point of requiring constant care, often institutionalized. Although a number of risk factors have been associated with AD, disease onset correlates best with age, and the large majority of cases occur in the elderly. Among people over age 85, over a third are afflicted. Two types of protein deposits are found in the AD brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2]. The former are extraneuronal and primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), whereas the latter are intraneuronal filaments of the normally microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuroinflammation is a third pathological feature of AD, in which microglia\\u2014phagocytic brain immune cells that release cytokines\\u2014become overactivated [3]. The role of each of these features in AD etiology and pathogenesis are not well understood. However, A\\u03b2 aggregation\\u2014in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques\\u2014is generally observed as the earliest pathology, followed by tau tangle formation and neurodegeneration [4]. For this reason and those mentioned in the next section, pathological A\\u03b2 is widely considered the initiator of AD, triggering downstream tau pathology and neuroinflammation, and A\\u03b2 has been the primary target for the development of AD therapeutics for over 25 years [5].

Evidence from mouse models suggest that the cognitive worsening may be due to increased \\u03b3-secretase substrates [80], although elevation of total A\\u03b2, seen in plasma at low inhibitor concentrations, may be responsible [81,82]. These findings have effectively halted further development of GSIs for AD. Interestingly though, these compounds may be repurposed for oncology, for the treatment of various cancers that involve overactive Notch signaling [83]. While GSIs are out of further consideration for AD therapeutics, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) are still of keen interest [84]. These compounds (see Figure 10 for examples) have the effect of lowering A\\u03b242 levels without decreasing overall A\\u03b2 levels or otherwise inhibiting general \\u03b3-secretase activity [85,86]. The decrease in A\\u03b242 is correlated with an increase in A\\u03b238, thereby replacing a highly aggregation-prone form of A\\u03b2 with a much more soluble form. Thus, these compounds can prevent the formation of plaques and other higher-order assembly states of A\\u03b242 in the brain. GSMs, however, have no effect, even at very high concentrations, on Notch proteolysis and signaling, nor do they elevate \\u03b3-secretase substrates. Presumably for these reasons, these compounds have shown excellent safety profiles, both in animal models and in human trials. The mechanism of action of these compounds is not entirely clear, although the correlation between A\\u03b242 lowering and A\\u03b238 elevation is relevant, as A\\u03b242 is a precursor to A\\u03b238. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves the A\\u03b242 C-terminus to release a tetrapeptide [45], and isolated \\u03b3-secretase converts synthetic A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 with release of this tetrapeptide [87]. Moreover, presenilin mutations decrease the A\\u03b242-to-A\\u03b238 conversion while GSMs stimulate it. Thus, GSMs appear to decrease A\\u03b242 by enhancing the carboxypeptidase activity of \\u03b3-secretase that converts this aggregation-prone peptide to A\\u03b238. A critical issue with GSMs, however, like all anti-A\\u03b2 therapeutic strategies, is the design of clinical trials [88]. So far, all reported clinical trials with candidate AD therapeutic agents, including GSIs, GSMs and anti-A\\u03b2 immunotherapy, have been with individuals who already have AD or a pre-AD condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Even in those with MCI, substantial neurodegeneration has occurred, and there are serious concerns that targeting A\\u03b2 after the onset of symptoms is too late. A\\u03b2 pathology in the brain may appear more than 10 years before the clinical manifestation of AD [89]. As A\\u03b2 pathology apparently precedes tau pathology [4,90], and tau pathology may then propagate from neuron to neuron [91,92], blocking A\\u03b2 after tau pathology is initiated may not prevent or slow the progression of AD and may not even prevent or delay disease onset. For anti-A\\u03b2 strategies\\u2014including GSMs\\u2014to succeed, clearer knowledge of the pathogenic process and timing is needed, as are convenient and reliable biomarkers and diagnostics. Moreover, the clinical success of GSMs is completely dependent on whether A\\u03b242 is indeed the pathogenic entity in AD. The reasons for the focus on A\\u03b242 are arguably more historic than a result of an objective search with no preconceptions.

Additionally, IFITM3 is associated with \\u03b3-secretase activity, where its knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) decreases A\\u03b2 production. In aging models, higher levels of IFITM3 correlate with increased \\u03b3-secretase activity and A\\u03b2 production, indicating potential therapeutic strategies targeting \\u03b3-secretase modulation to reduce A\\u03b242 levels.\\n\\n8\": {\n",

Another environmental factor, such as stress, activates G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as \\u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\\u03b22-AR) and \\u03b4-opioid receptor205. \\u03b22-AR agonists stimulate A\\u03b2 production via (1) the association with PS1, (2) the endocytosis of the receptor, and (3) the trafficking of \\u03b3-secretase to late endosomes and lysosomes205. High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with GPR3 KO mice also decreased A\\u03b2 production, and GPR3 was expressed in the brains of SAD patients92. GPCRs require adaptor proteins such as arrestins to prevent further G protein-mediated signaling206. \\u03b2-Arrestin1 is highly expressed in the brain206, and \\u03b2-arrestin1 KO mice exhibit reduced A\\u03b2 production and spared Notch cleavage207. \\u03b2-arrestin1 interacts only with Aph-1 in \\u03b3-secretase, and overexpression of \\u03b2-arrestin1 enhanced mature \\u03b3-secretase complex formation at 440\\u2009kDa207. KO of \\u03b2-arrestin1 in APP/PS1 mice decreased A\\u03b2 production and improved memory deficits207. Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) was also reported to regulate the assembly of \\u03b3-secretase complexes and contribute to A\\u03b2 pathogenesis208. SERP1 interacts with the Aph-1a/Nct subcomplex of \\u03b3-secretase and increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 generation but reduces Notch processing208. Recently, IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3, also known as fragilis) was identified as an imidazole GSM, E2012, binding protein158. Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211. Hur et al.158 showed that IFITM3 binds to PS1-NTF in active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production (A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242) (Fig. 6). KD or KO of IFITM3 decreased A\\u03b2 production, and overexpression of IFITM3 increased A\\u03b2 levels in IFITM3 KO cells158. Moreover, crossing IFITM3 KO mice with 5XFAD Tg mice decreased A\\u03b2 production and amyloid plaque formation in the cortex and hippocampus158. Aging mouse models also showed increased IFITM3 levels, \\u03b3-secretase activity, and active IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase complex formation levels by aging158. A positive correlation between the amount of active IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase complexes and the high \\u03b3-secretase activity resulting in high A\\u03b2 production was shown in the subsets of SAD patient\",\n",

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

      "### Clinical Target Rationale for Gamma Secretase in Alzheimer's Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "**Target Location Relevance to Disease Biology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase (GSEC) is a multi-subunit protease complex that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This cleavage leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which aggregate to form amyloid plaques—a hallmark of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Elevated levels of Aβ42 contribute to neurotoxicity by impairing GSEC activity, which is crucial for APP processing (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The involvement of GSEC in the amyloidogenic pathway makes it a crucial target for therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing Aβ levels and mitigating synaptic dysfunction associated with AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Altered Target Expression in Human Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of AD, the expression and activity of gamma secretase components, particularly presenilin (PS), are altered. Mutations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to familial forms of AD, leading to dysregulated Aβ production (Szaruga et al., 2015). Studies indicate that PSEN1 mutations can significantly reduce Aβ40 production while not necessarily affecting Aβ42 levels, thus altering the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio critical for disease pathology (Bagaria et al., 2022). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) occurs in conditions where presenilin function is impaired, indicating a direct relationship between gamma secretase activity and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018; De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Physiological Processes Relevant to Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase is involved in various physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling. Its cleavage of APP not only generates Aβ but also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which is implicated in transcriptional regulation (Steiner et al., 2018). Dysregulation of these processes due to altered gamma secretase activity can contribute to synaptic dysfunction, a precursor to cognitive decline in AD patients (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). Additionally, the presenilin hypothesis suggests that PSEN1 mutations may lead to gain-of-function mechanisms that enhance Aβ production, further complicating the disease's progression (Kurth et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic studies have identified several phenotypes associated with gamma secretase activity. For instance, mutations in presenilin genes are strongly associated with early-onset familial AD, resulting in increased Aβ levels and aggregation (Szaruga et al., 2015; Wolfe, 2021). The phenotypic diversity of PSEN1 mutations can yield various clinical outcomes, with some mutations leading to atypical symptoms (Bagaria et al., 2022). Additionally, variations in the APOE gene, particularly the ε4 allele, have been linked to altered Aβ metabolism and increased AD risk, indicating a complex interaction with gamma secretase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Genetic Link Between Target and Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma secretase and AD is well-established, particularly through mutations in presenilin genes. These mutations lead to altered enzymatic activity, favoring the production of Aβ42 over Aβ40, thus enhancing amyloid plaque formation and contributing to the pathophysiology of AD (Welander et al., 2009). This genetic predisposition highlights the importance of targeting gamma secretase to modulate Aβ levels and potentially alter disease progression (Wolfe, 2021). Furthermore, the presenilin hypothesis posits that PSEN1 mutations could act as dominant-negative antimorphs, obstructing the function of wild-type PSEN1 (Kurth et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence from Clinical Studies and Pathway Tools:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma secretase have faced challenges, such as the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat due to cognitive decline in patients (Hur, 2022). However, ongoing research continues to explore more selective inhibitors and modulators that can effectively reduce Aβ production while minimizing off-target effects. The study by Course et al. (2023) highlights the role of aberrant splicing patterns of PSEN2 in sporadic AD, suggesting that transcript differences in PSEN2 may also contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Additionally, tools that enhance synaptic plasticity and counteract neuroinflammation are being investigated as potential adjunct therapies in conjunction with gamma secretase modulation (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Required Target Modulation for Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To effectively treat AD, a nuanced approach to gamma secretase modulation is necessary. This includes the development of selective inhibitors that can reduce Aβ production without compromising the proteolytic functions of gamma secretase essential for normal cellular processes (Wolfe, 2021). The selective inhibition of specific gamma secretase complexes, particularly those containing PSEN1, may provide a safer therapeutic window with fewer side effects (Serneels et al., 2023). Furthermore, personalized medicine strategies, such as gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, are being explored to correct specific presenilin mutations linked to familial AD, offering a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic interventions (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "To effectively treat Alzheimer's disease, a nuanced approach to gamma secretase modulation is required. Strategies may include the development of selective gamma secretase modulators (SGSMs) that preferentially lower Aβ42 production while preserving Notch signaling activity. This selective modulation could help mitigate the neurotoxic effects of Aβ42 accumulation while maintaining the physiological functions of gamma secretase (Veugelen et al., 2016).\n",

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive neurodegenerative disorder, marked by memory loss and a decline in cognitive function. The major hallmarks of AD are the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and extracellular plaques composed of amyloid beta peptides (A\\u03b2). The amyloid (A\\u03b2) cascade hypothesis proposes that the AD pathogenesis is initiated by the accumulation of A\\u03b2 peptides in the parenchyma of the brain. An aspartyl intramembranal protease called \\u03b3-secretase is responsible for the production of A\\u03b2 by the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Clinical studies of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) for AD failed due to the lack of substrate specificity. Therefore, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed as potential disease modifying agents to modulate the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage activity towards the production of toxic A\\u03b242 peptides.

On the other hand, a co-immunoprecipitation study against \\u03b3-secretase complex components pulled down both active and inactive \\u03b3-secretase complexes. In animal studies, GSIs successfully reduced A\\u03b2 production. DAPT decreased A\\u03b2 levels in the plasma, CSF, or brain of AD transgenic mice117,120. Chronic treatment with LY-411,575 in AD transgenic mice reduced A\\u03b2 but also inhibited Notch signaling, leading to side effects121. Semagacestat (LY-450,139) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163) in Tg2576 mice reduced A\\u03b2 production while increasing APP-CTF122. However, those GSIs impaired normal cognition in wild-type mice122. Begacestat (GSI-953) reduced A\\u03b2 levels in Tg2576 mice123. In clinical trials, GSIs such as semagacestat (LY-450,139, Eli Lilly) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163, Bristol-Myers Squibb) reduced A\\u03b2 production in AD patients124,125. However, the multitude of \\u03b3-secretase substrates has made the development of clinically useful inhibitors difficult. Due to the decreased Notch signaling and the accumulation of APP-CTFs122, side effects such as the risk of skin cancer and infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and worsening cognition led to the pause of clinical trials5,124,125. Therefore, these GSIs are nonselective and inhibit both APP and Notch121,124,126. Avagacestat was reported as a \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI and was shown to have a higher selectivity for APP over Notch cleavage127. However, avagacestat was suggested to be nonselective later based on poor Notch-sparing activity122,128 and its binding site as PS1-NTF128. Another \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI, begacestat (GSI-953, Wyeth/Pfizer), was also discontinued in phase I clinical trial, and the reasons are unclear129. Another concern regarding GSI treatment is the A\\u03b2 rebound effect. GSIs at lower doses increased A\\u03b2 levels, and discontinuation of GSI treatment was observed with a rebound of A\\u03b2 levels130,131. These GSIs target PS1-NTF128. GSIs have been repurposed in the cancer field for Notch signaling inhibition and are currently in clinical trials. Instead of inhibiting the whole \\u03b3-secretase activity, modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity by \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) has been tested. GSMs are more attractive disease-modifying agents than GSIs because GSMs (1) inhibit selectively aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 production, (2) increase shorter A\\u03b237 or A\\u03b238 species, (3) do not affect the total A\\u03b2 production and the accumulation of APP-CTF, and (4) spare Notch processing132.

These NSAIDs lowered A\\u03b242 and increased A\\u03b238 without affecting Notch cleavage133. This A\\u03b2 modulation was not due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity, the pharmacological target of NSAIDs133.

Deeper mechanistic insight on the generation of A\\u03b243 is still lacking, and it is unclear whether \\u03b3\\u2010secretase modulators (GSMs) can reduce the levels of this A\\u03b2 species. By comparing several types of A\\u03b243\\u2010generating FAD mutants, we observe that very high levels of A\\u03b243 are often produced when presenilin function is severely impaired. Altered interactions of C99, the precursor of A\\u03b2, are found for all mutants and are independent of their particular effect on A\\u03b2 production. Furthermore, unlike previously described GSMs, the novel compound RO7019009 can effectively lower A\\u03b243 production of all mutants. Finally, substrate\\u2010binding competition experiments suggest that RO7019009 acts mechanistically after initial C99 binding.

The various A\\u03b2 species, 37\\u201343 amino acids in length, are generated from the C99 fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2), the catalytic subunits of the intramembrane\\u2010cleaving protease \\u03b3\\u2010secretase 2.

      "        \"original_text\": \"affinity mapping. A major question of this study was whether A\\u03b243 could be lowered by GSMs, especially when generated in abnormal amounts by particular PS1 FAD mutants. Previous in\\u00a0vitro studies including patient\\u2010derived neuronal cells showed that A\\u03b242 could be lowered for many presenilin FAD mutants by potent GSMs 26, 27, 28 opening treatment possibilities, for example, within the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) 39, based on a rational selection of a GSM effective for a given presenilin FAD mutation. We now show that A\\u03b243 production can also be inhibited by modulation of \\u03b3\\u2010secretase activity. We identified RO7019009 as a potent GSM with CNS drug\\u2010like properties, which could lower A\\u03b243 generation in all investigated mutants. These include the PS1 R278I and PS1 L166P mutants for which the well\\u2010characterized GSMs RO\\u201002 and GSM\\u20101 showed strongly reduced efficacy as compared to PS1 WT. However, although RO7019009 could efficiently inhibit the generation of A\\u03b243 in all the mutants, remarkably, for some of the mutants including the strong A\\u03b243\\u2010overproducing PS1 mutants V261F and R278I, their concomitant A\\u03b242 production could only be inhibited at higher RO7019009 concentrations and only to small extents. The same observation was also made for the L166P mutant, but not for the Y256S mutant, which has a very similar A\\u03b2 profile as the L166P mutant. For the PS1 Y256S mutant, production of both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 could be efficiently inhibited at low RO7019009 concentrations. In addition, generation of the shorter A\\u03b2 species was differentially affected by RO7019009 in the various mutants. Some mutants were modulated in a way that increased levels of both A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238, while others showed only minor or no generation of A\\u03b237 while still producing high levels of A\\u03b238. These observations suggest that RO7019009 differentially affects the two product lines in certain mutants resulting in, e.g., less effective A\\u03b242 reduction or generation of predominantly A\\u03b238. GSMs have been shown to reduce the dissociation of A\\u03b242\\u2013\\u03b3\\u2010secretase complexes and increase their stability 31, 38. The resulting longer substrate residence time would thereby allow more efficient carboxy\\u2010terminal processing toward shorter A\\u03b2 species. Mutational analysis further showed that the activity of GSMs is affected by K28 and nearby residues of the extracellular TMD border of C99 40, 41, 42. As shown very recently, these effects relate functionally to the proximity of K28 to NCT 36, 43 and indicate this contact region with C99 and/or A\\u03b2 also as part of a GSM binding site 44. Since it remained possible that RO7019009 may exert its activity by affecting the interaction of C99 with \\u03b3\\u2010secretase, we probed the crosslinking of V44, which represents the position of C99 that shows the most efficient crosslink in the PS1 NTF 22. While two mutants did not change crosslinking in the presence of the GSM, it was decreased for WT PS1 and most mutants, although to different extents. Notably, total \\u03b3\\u2010secretase activity was unaffected by the GSM. Thus, the crosslinking changes induced by RO7019009 seem to be due to a slightly changed substrate\\u2013enzyme complex conformation causing altered local substrate docking rather than decreased\\u00a0overall substrate binding. However, since clear effects of allosteric\\u00a0modulation by RO7019009 at this major interaction site of \\u03b3\\u2010secretase were observed only at very high concentrations of the GSM, it is probable that these effects are not relevant for the activity of the GSM. Rather, the interactions with \\u03b3\\u2010secretase could be changed for long A\\u03b2 species, which become the ensuing substrates after C99 has been cleaved \",\n",

These compounds would therefore offer a preferred treatment strategy over a broad inhibition of substrate cleavage, which is considered a main reason among others, such as pseudo\\u2010inhibition 9, for the failure of \\u03b3\\u2010secretase inhibitors in clinical trials 10. Mutations in PS1 represent the major cause of early\\u2010onset familial AD (FAD). They lead to the generation of abnormal relative amounts of the longer A\\u03b2 forms as a result of a reduced carboxy\\u2010terminal processivity 11, 12. In support of their pathogenicity, changes in the ratios of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b240 correlate with the clinical age of onset of the particular PS1 FAD mutant 13. While it has been well established that A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios are increased for PS1 and PS2 FAD mutants 14, 15, in a few cases such as the PS1 R278I or PS1 L435F mutants increased levels of A\\u03b243 rather than A\\u03b242 are observed 16, 17, 18. For these mutants, the processivity changes appear also to be associated with a stronger loss of function in the \\u03b5\\u2010site cleavage of C99 16, 17, 19. However, since deficiencies in the initial \\u03b5\\u2010site cleavage are largely compensated by the unaffected wt PS1 and PS2 alleles in human FAD brain, while pathogenic A\\u03b2 ratios persist 20, it is unlikely that FAD mutant \\u03b3\\u2010secretases show an impact on signaling functions. PS1 and PS2 normally undergo presenilin endoproteolysis 21 in which they are autoproteolytically cleaved into N\\u2010 and C\\u2010terminal fragments (NTF, CTF) 2; however, in a few FAD mutants, this step is blocked or impaired. This is also and prominently seen for the PS1 R278I and PS1 L435F mutants 16, 17, 18, 19 indicating that their strong deficiency in presenilin endoproteolysis may contribute to their loss in processivity thereby resulting in the formation of longer A\\u03b243 species. In an attempt to better understand the molecular characteristics and disease mechanisms of clinical presenilin mutants, we recently observed that two A\\u03b242\\u2010increasing FAD mutants show altered interaction/positioning of the C99 cleavage site domain within the active site region of \\u03b3\\u2010secretase 22. In the current study, we wanted to examine whether this may also be a property for the A\\u03b243\\u2010increasing mutants, possibly even more severe, or whether their altered cleavage activities may be unrelated to substrate positioning changes. Since A\\u03b243 is considered to be the major pathogenic species for these FAD cases, we also investigated whether a GSM could lower the aberrant A\\u03b243 levels generated by these mutants and whether such a compound would have effects on the interaction with C99. We found significant changes in the C99 interactions with \\u03b3\\u2010secretase around the \\u03b5\\u2010sites for the A\\u03b243\\u2010generating PS1 FAD mutants, showing that altered interactions of this region of C99 with PS1 can also be linked to the aberrant generation of this long A\\u03b2 variant. In contrast to other well\\u2010characterized GSMs, RO7019009, a novel and potent GSM, could lower A\\u03b243 for all mutants analyzed. Although RO7019009 could affect to some extent the interaction of C99 with WT PS1 and some of the mutants, there was no clear correlation between these changes and the capability of the GSM to lower A\\u03b242/43. We conclude that A\\u03b243 can be targeted by GSMs and that altered substrate interactions are a common characteristic of presenilin FAD mutants associated with the generation\",\n",

An A\\u03b242/40 ratio increase could be due to increased A\\u03b242 production, decreased A\\u03b240 production, or a combination of both111.

In addition, further studies addressing the effect of PS FAD mutations on the structure of \\u03b3-secretase and how those conformational changes could affect the cleavage of different substrates by \\u03b3-secretase remain to be investigated. For instance, E280 in PS1 forms hydrogen bonds with Y159 and Y154102. PS1 E280A (the Columbian mutation) disrupts hydrogen bonds and causes a local conformational change102.

      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase (GSEC) is a multi-subunit protease complex that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This cleavage leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which aggregate to form amyloid plaques—a hallmark of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Elevated levels of Aβ42 contribute to neurotoxicity by impairing GSEC activity, which is crucial for APP processing (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The involvement of GSEC in the amyloidogenic pathway makes it a crucial target for therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing Aβ levels and mitigating synaptic dysfunction associated with AD.\n",

      "**Altered Target Expression in Human Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of AD, the expression and activity of gamma secretase components, particularly presenilin (PS), are altered. Mutations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to familial forms of AD, leading to dysregulated Aβ production (Szaruga et al., 2015). Studies indicate that PSEN1 mutations can significantly reduce Aβ40 production while not necessarily affecting Aβ42 levels, thus altering the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio critical for disease pathology (Bagaria et al., 2022). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) occurs in conditions where presenilin function is impaired, indicating a direct relationship between gamma secretase activity and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018; De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",

      "Gamma secretase is involved in various physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling. Its cleavage of APP not only generates Aβ but also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which is implicated in transcriptional regulation (Steiner et al., 2018). Dysregulation of these processes due to altered gamma secretase activity can contribute to synaptic dysfunction, a precursor to cognitive decline in AD patients (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). Additionally, the presenilin hypothesis suggests that PSEN1 mutations may lead to gain-of-function mechanisms that enhance Aβ production, further complicating the disease's progression (Kurth et al., 2023).\n",

For instance, mutations in presenilin genes are strongly associated with early-onset familial AD, resulting in increased Aβ levels and aggregation (Szaruga et al., 2015; Wolfe, 2021). The phenotypic diversity of PSEN1 mutations can yield various clinical outcomes, with some mutations leading to atypical symptoms (Bagaria et al., 2022). Additionally, variations in the APOE gene, particularly the ε4 allele, have been linked to altered Aβ metabolism and increased AD risk, indicating a complex interaction with gamma secretase activity.\n",

      "The genetic link between gamma secretase and AD is well-established, particularly through mutations in presenilin genes. These mutations lead to altered enzymatic activity, favoring the production of Aβ42 over Aβ40, thus enhancing amyloid plaque formation and contributing to the pathophysiology of AD (Welander et al., 2009). This genetic predisposition highlights the importance of targeting gamma secretase to modulate Aβ levels and potentially alter disease progression (Wolfe, 2021). Furthermore, the presenilin hypothesis posits that PSEN1 mutations could act as dominant-negative antimorphs, obstructing the function of wild-type PSEN1 (Kurth et al., 2023).\n",

      "**Genetic Link Between Target and Disease:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma secretase and AD is well-established, particularly through mutations in presenilin genes. These mutations lead to altered enzymatic activity, favoring the production of Aβ42 over Aβ40, thus enhancing amyloid plaque formation and contributing to the pathophysiology of AD (Welander et al., 2009). This genetic predisposition highlights the importance of targeting gamma secretase to modulate Aβ levels and potentially alter disease progression (Wolfe, 2021). Furthermore, the presenilin hypothesis posits that PSEN1 mutations could act as dominant-negative antimorphs, obstructing the function of wild-type PSEN1 (Kurth et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence from Clinical Studies and Pathway Tools:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma secretase have faced challenges, such as the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat due to cognitive decline in patients (Hur, 2022). However, ongoing research continues to explore more selective inhibitors and modulators that can effectively reduce Aβ production while minimizing off-target effects. The study by Course et al. (2023) highlights the role of aberrant splicing patterns of PSEN2 in sporadic AD, suggesting that transcript differences in PSEN2 may also contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Additionally, tools that enhance synaptic plasticity and counteract neuroinflammation are being investigated as potential adjunct therapies in conjunction with gamma secretase modulation (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Required Target Modulation for Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To effectively treat AD, a nuanced approach to gamma secretase modulation is necessary. This includes the development of selective inhibitors that can reduce Aβ production without compromising the proteolytic functions of gamma secretase essential for normal cellular processes (Wolfe, 2021). The selective inhibition of specific gamma secretase complexes, particularly those containing PSEN1, may provide a safer therapeutic window with fewer side effects (Serneels et al., 2023). Furthermore, personalized medicine strategies, such as gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, are being explored to correct specific presenilin mutations linked to familial AD, offering a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic interventions (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",

Gene mutations in presenilin have been remarkably diverse, with over 200 different forms identified, implicated in approximately 90% of familial AD pedigrees [1]. Presenilin\\u2019s primary involvement in AD stems from its role as the catalytic core of the \\u03b3-secretase complex, a transmembrane protein with nine membrane-spanning domains [2].

This process leads to the generation of A\\u03b2 peptides, a hallmark feature in AD pathology [3].

Going beyond traditional perspectives, we emphasize the wide-ranging roles of presenilin in cell biology, offering a fresh perspective on unraveling the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.

In 2013, the number of genome-wide significant susceptibility loci for AD was doubled by the mega meta-analysis of a sample of 74,046 persons reported by the International Genomics of Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease Project (Lambert et al. 2013). In this study, 11 novel association signals were reported, i.e. DSG2 (desmoglein 2), PTK2B (protein tyrosine kinase 2\\u03b2), SORL1 (sortilin-related receptor, L(DLR Class) A Repeats Containing), SLC24A4 (solute carrier family 24 member 4), INPP5D (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphat-ase 1), MEF2C (myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C), NME8 (NME/NM23 family member 8), ZCWPW1 (zinc finger CW-type and PWWP domain containing 1), CELF1 (CUGBP, Elav-like family member 1), FERMT2 (fermitin family member 2), and CASS4 (Cas scaffolding protein family member 4). Conversely to APOE, none of these novel signals increased the susceptibility to LOAD by more than 2-fold (odds ratio, OR =2) (Lambert et al. 2013). Thus in view of their small ORs, genetic variants within these loci are unlikely to be causative. Despite this, the candidate risk genes named by GWAS provided further support to the amyloid cascade hypothesis because some these gene signal are linked to A\\u03b2 homeostasis and/or Tau pathology (Lambert and Amouyel 2011). On the other hand, clustering the genes in biological pathways revealed three main pathways involved in LOAD besides A\\u03b2 and Tau, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, immune system and inflammatory response, and endosomal vesicle cycling. This observation was further supported by an alternative approach to classical case\\u2013control GWAS called pathway analysis (Jones et al. 2010; IGAP 2015). Thus, the past years have witnessed major advances in the understanding of the genetics of LOAD. However, awareness that genetic research into LOAD has not reached its limit is increasing. Ridge et al. (2016), for example, have estimated that 69% of the genetic variance in AD remains unexplained by known AD-risk variants, leaving an important part of the heritability of LOAD as yet unexplained. The hope to catch this missing heritability has motivated development of novel approaches to search for rare variants (minor allele frequency <1%) that cannot be found by classical GWAS approaches. Herein, next-generation sequencing (NGS)/whole-exome sequencing have already enabled the identification of causative mutations in families and sporadic cases for whom linkage analysis was not possible, including mutations in SORL1 (Pottier et al. 2012) and TREM2 (Guerreiro et al. 2013; Jonsson et al. 2013). Furthermore, NGS has allowed the identification of rare variants in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, which increase the risk for AD in LOAD families (Cruchaga et al. 2012). These studies underscore the value of this technology in the search for rare variants/mutations in families and sporadic cases with no mutations in known AD\",\n",

In summary, trials with \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have clearly shown that CSF biomarkers can be used to verify drug-target engagement and a similar paradigm can be applied to other therapeutic strategies. There is evidence that adequate markers of target engagement might not necessarily capture disease-modifying effects (Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015). The theragnostic value of each biomarker should be individually assessed based on its association to cognitive or functional endpoints. To date, all drugs attempting to modify the course of AD have failed in their primary clinical endpoints. For this reason, it is difficult to address the question of whether CSF biomarkers can predict clinical response. In addition, the total number of patients with CSF measures in clinical trials is still low, further limiting the possibilities to draw firm conclusions. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as surrogate markers of disease modification and as indicators of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The trial with AN1792, the first active A\\u03b2 immunisation study showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo (Gilman et al. 2005). However, treatment with CAD106, another active immunotherapy, did not change the levels of Tau or pTau (Winblad et al. 2012). Most trials with passive immunisation have also included Tau markers in CSF in a subset of subjects. Treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels in both the phase II and phase III trials (Blennow et al. 2012; Salloway et al. 2014). However, this effect was not observed after treatment with solaneuzumab (Doody et al. 2014). These findings could be interpreted as if treatments that act on fibrillar A\\u03b2 have a greater impact on downstream neurodegeneration than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2 (Lleo et al. 2015). Results from ongoing studies with these and other anti-amyloid treatments might shed new biological evidence for the role of CSF markers to detect disease modification. In addition to Tau and pTau, other proteins have been investigated in CSF to monitor the pathophysiological pathways in AD. These novel biomarkers could provide further insights in clinical trials. Tau-independent markers of neuronal damage, such as NF-L, VLP-1, or the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, could give additional information about disease modification effects in trials with anti-Tau therapies, in which levels of total Tau and pTau could be the result of target engagement (Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Synaptic markers (NG, SNAP-25), markers of neuroinflammation/microglial activation (YKL-40 or CCL2) and markers of protein homeostasis and lysosomal dysfunction (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) could be used as indicators of disease progression (Alcolea et al. 2014; Cavedo et al. 2014; Alcolea et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Markers to detect common associated neuropathological comorbidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al.\",\n",

In contrast, APP can be cleaved by \\u03b2-secretase, for example BACE1, creating a cytotoxic, soluble sAPP\\u03b2. The proteolysis by \\u03b2-secretase exposes A\\u03b2 peptide, which is further cleaved by \\u03b3-secretase. This cleavage results in the release of A\\u03b2 monomers into the extracellular space, where they can further polymerize forming A\\u03b2 oligomers, and later A\\u03b2 plaques. This pathway is neurotoxic and is called amyloidogenic pathway The strongest genetic evidence behind AD pathogenesis is linked to familial early-onset AD (EOAD), which accounts for 5\\u201310% of all AD cases. EOAD diagnosis has been mostly associated to autosomal-dominant mutations in three genes that result in increased levels and aggregation of A\\u03b2. They are APP, and APP-cleaving \\u03b3-secretase presenilin components, PSEN1 and PSEN2. However, the majority of patients are diagnosed with sporadic, late-onset AD (LOAD), the heritability of which is estimated to be between 60 and 80% [11, 12]. Hence, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) investigating up to 150,000 AD cases have identified a number of risk genes underscoring the polygenic nature of LOAD [11, 13, 14]. Most recently, a study incorporating more than 100,000 AD cases and almost 700,000 control individuals identified 75 risk loci, of which 42 had not previously been described [14]. Functional annotation of the risk genes indicated that amyloid aggregation, Tau phosphorylation, endocytosis, intracellular vesicle trafficking, altered lipid metabolism, and immune responses are critically involved in the pathogenesis of LOAD [2, 13\\u201318]. Notably, around 40% of LOAD patients carry a disease-associated SNP in the gene encoding Apolipoprotein E (APOE), which exists in 3 polymorphic alleles called E2, E3, and E4. Due to such high incidence, APOE polymorphism is considered the most important genetic risk factor for LOAD [19\\u201321]. ApoE has multiple physiological functions, but it is mostly known for transportation of cholesterol and other lipids through the circulation system as well as within the brain parenchyma. Even though all human ApoE isoforms interact with A\\u03b2, the functional outcome is different [22]. While ApoE2 shows neuroprotective features, ApoE4 represents the major risk factor for AD due to its involvement in A\\u03b2 processing [23]. The possession of ApoE4 allele leads to intracellular accumulation of A\\u03b2 by enhancing the uptake of A\\u03b2 peptides, resulting in the enlargement of endosomal compartments, subsequent endosomal-lysosomal pathway dysregulation, and thus decreased clearance of A\\u03b2 [24]. Several other mechanisms have been described for ApoE4 in relation to AD, including neuronal hyperactivation [25], increased Tau phosphorylation [26], modulation of neuroinflammatory pathways [23], and impaired synaptic plasticity [27]. Such abnormalities, fueled by reduced trophic support, are considered major drivers behind the progression of AD. For this reason, impairments in\",\n",

This dysregulation can result from altered store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) mechanisms, which play a critical role in maintaining neuronal function. A study by Cheung et al. [34] demonstrated that mutant presenilin disrupts SOCE, leading to abnormal calcium signaling in neurons. This disruption can trigger excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately neuronal death. Another study has also demonstrated that presenilin interacts with synaptic proteins, including PSD-95, critical for synaptic structure and function [35]. These alterations in synaptic function contribute to memory deficits and cognitive impairment in AD patients. Therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving synaptic integrity by targeting presenilin-related mechanisms hold promise for AD treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that presenilin also plays a role in neuroinflammation, a key feature of AD pathology. Mutant presenilin can activate microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [36,37]. This chronic inflammatory response exacerbates neuronal damage and accelerates disease progression. Targeting presenilin-related neuroinflammation represents a potential avenue for AD therapeutics. AD is characterized not only by A\\u03b2 pathology but also by widespread neuronal network dysfunction. Presenilin mutations have been linked to aberrant network activity in the brain. Research by Palop et al. [38] demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing mutant presenilin exhibit hippocampal hyperexcitability and epileptic seizures, suggesting a role for presenilin in regulating neuronal network activity. These findings underscore the far-reaching consequences of presenilin dysfunction beyond A\\u03b2 production. Neuronal loss is a hallmark of advanced AD. Dysregulated A\\u03b2 production, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction driven by presenilin mutations all contribute to progressive neurodegeneration [39]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying presenilin-mediated neuronal loss is crucial for developing interventions that can preserve neuronal function and slow disease progression. Presenilin\\u2019s involvement in apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is another causative factor for neuronal loss. Dysregulated apoptosis is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Studies have shown that increased sensitivity to apoptosis in neural cells expressing mutant presenilin-1 is linked to perturbed calcium homeostasis and enhanced oxyradical production [40,41,42]. Another study demonstrated that mutant PS-2 not only induced p53 expression but also led to an increase in miR-34a expression. This suggests that mutant PS-2\",\n",

Research on Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) has spurred investigations into therapeutic approaches targeting the \\u03b3-secretase complex, particularly its crucial component, presenilin. Drug development aimed at modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity for AD treatment faces challenges, as the complex is involved in various cellular processes with potential unintended consequences upon inhibition. Several drugs, such as semagacestat and avagacestat, targeting \\u03b3-secretase, underwent clinical trials but were discontinued due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in some patients [113]. Ongoing research seeks to refine \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors for improved safety and efficacy. Alternative strategies focus on mitigating neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction associated with presenilin dysfunction. Anti-inflammatory drugs and immunomodulatory therapies are being explored to counteract neuroinflammation in AD [36]. Efforts to enhance synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission through pharmacological interventions are also underway [114]. Personalized medicine approaches are gaining momentum, recognizing the need for tailored treatments based on specific presenilin mutations. Gene editing technologies have been explored to correct certain presenilin mutations [115]. Recent studies have shown that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology is able to selectively disrupt PSEN1 mutations leading to an autosomal dominant form of early-onset AD and counteract the AD-associated phenotype [116,117]. Despite challenges, targeting the \\u03b3-secretase complex, especially presenilin, remains a therapeutic focus in AD research. Balancing the reduction of amyloid beta production with the preservation of essential \\u03b3-secretase functions poses a significant challenge in AD drug development [118]. Presenilin, initially identified for its role in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), has emerged as a multifunctional protein with diverse roles in cellular physiology and pathology. Beyond its well-known involvement in A\\u03b2 production, presenilin plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling, synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, Notch signaling, autophagy, ER stress, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, blood\\u2013brain barrier integrity, and tau pathology. In addition, we have summarized some recently discovered new functions of presenilin, including trafficking function, regulation of APOE secretion, interaction with ApoE and change of \\u03b3-secretase activity in different APOE genotypes, induction of oxidative damage through ferritin, and alteration of ACE-mediated A\\u03b242-to-A\\u03b240-converting activity. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying presenilin\\u2019s multifaceted roles is crucial for gaining insights into both normal cellular physiology and the pathogenesis of various diseases, including AD. The \\u03b3-secretase complex, with presenilin at its core, serves as critical molecular machinery involved in the processing of multiple transmembrane proteins, including Notch and APP. Dysregulation of \\u03b3-secretase activity due to presenilin mutations disrupts the cleavage of these substrates, leading to profound consequences in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. While challenges remain, ongoing research into presenilin and its associated pathways offers hope for novel therapeutic interventions that can slow or even halt the progression of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Despite very limited knowledge about the molecular function of SorCS3, there is substantial evidence for its implications in AD. Similarly to SorCS1 and -2, SorCS3 exhibits spatiotemporal expression during development. In the adulthood, SorCS3 is expressed across the brain, with the highest expression in the CA1 region of hippocampus and in cerebral cortex [121, 122]. SorCS3 mostly localizes at the plasma membrane where it binds its ligands. Using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy at neutral pH, Dong et al. recently suggested that human SorCS3 exists mostly as a dimer since they observed 79% of dimer particles compared to 21% of monomer particles [156]. Interestingly, SorCS3 monomer contained 10CC domain in different orientation than the dimers. They detected three different conformations of the dimers, and suggested that SorCS3 exhibits dynamic conformational changes, which differed from SorLA and SorCS2, especially in the possible ligand-binding features. However, this structural study is still quite preliminary. SorCS3 interacts with its binding partners even prior to its maturation by propeptide cleavage [136]. The SorCS3 cytoplasmic tail is responsible for its intracellular trafficking as it navigates SorCS3 into dendrites and to a lower extent also into axons [122] (Fig.\\u00a08). The major function of SorCS3 is to control synaptic structure and function, via binding of scaffold proteins and controlling glutamate receptor trafficking [354, 355]. However, SorCS3 involvement in neurotrophin signaling has been proposed [136, 144]. In 2013, Reitz et al. described for the first time that SORCS3 is genetically associated to AD (12 SNPs). An epistatic analysis of the AD cohort revealed a strong interaction of SORCS3 mutations with those in SORCS2 (24 SNP pairs) and SORCS1 (8 SNP pairs). These mutations were all located in introns 1 and 2, thus the introns contiguous to the exons encoding the ligand-binding VPS10 domain (similarly to SNPs found in SORCS1 and SORCS2) [84]. Further, a recent whole genome sequence analysis of a multiethnic cohort comprising 11,000 women, found a strong genome-wide significant association between SORCS3 and dementia with an odds-ratio of no less than 4.4. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that SorCS3 expression is indeed substantially decreased in the context of AD [356]. These studies found that SorCS3 is consistently downregulated in AD [84, 357]. Recently, the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium identified SORCS3 as a shared top-risk gene across 8 different psychiatric disorders highlighting the pleiotropic though unclear function of SorCS3 in healthy and diseased human brain [90]. This is interestingly given a GWAS analysis from a Han Chinese cohort of AD patients with major depressive disorder further identified 675 SNPs in SORCS3 gene, thus bridging these two commonly comorbid disorders [358, 359] with one risk factor [90, 360]. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss the direct and indirect functional links of SorCS3 to AD.Fig. \",\n",

By using mutant Tau transgenic mice (P301S), prion-propagation assay, and inhibitory antibodies against Sortilin, Johnson et al. found that Sortilin activity suppresses replication of Tau prion in the forebrain thus protecting it against neurotoxic pTau aggregation. On contrary, Sortilin expression is lower in the hindbrain where it does not protect against p-Tau accumulation [223]. AD shares several other mechanisms with Prion diseases, a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders which major genetic component is neuronal Prion protein (PrPC). PrpC is a transmembrane receptor localized in lipid rafts [251] that regulates neuronal excitability and neurite outgrowth [252]. PrPc inhibits BACE1 and Tau expression, which subsequently reduces the levels of A\\u03b2 in the brain [253]. During AD, PrPC converts into its polymerizing, misfolded form called scrapie isoform PrPSc, which binds A\\u03b2O, and transduces their cytotoxic signals across the neuronal membrane [254\\u2013256] causing synaptic failure and cognitive impairments [257\\u2013261]. Upon A\\u03b2O binding, PrPC is phosphorylated by Fyn kinase leading to hyperactivation of NMDAR channels, and subsequent glutamate toxicity. Furthermore, A\\u03b2O-PrPC complex physically binds its co-receptor the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which activates the Fyn kinase, followed by eEF2 phosphorylation, and consequent loss of neuritic spines and memory [262\\u2013264]. At the plasma membrane, PrPC binds A\\u03b2 oligomers with high-affinity, yet during aging, A\\u03b2O-PrP complexes eventually accumulate extracellularly in form of plaques, even before AD manifestation [265]. Thus, targeting receptors involved in A\\u03b2O signal transduction such as PrPC and mGluR5, or disrupting the A\\u03b2O-PrPC complex holds therapeutic potential in AD patients [266]. Indeed, a recent study discovered that a PrPC antagonist blocks the protein aggregation, and rescues the A\\u03b2-related synapse loss and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice [267], similarly to mGluR5 antagonist [262].\\u00a0Strikingly, Uchiyama et al. showed that Sortilin is neuroprotective against the prion spreading as it internalizes PrPC and PrPSc, and transports them into lysosomes for their degradation. However, PrP can be a determinant of Sortilin activity since increased accumulation of cytotoxic PrPSc leads to lysosomal degradation of Sortilin resulting in progressive propagation of PrPSc [268]. Accordingly, Sortilin deficiency leads to early accumulation of PrPSc, and accelerated disease progression and death of the mice. These observations pinpoint the neuroprotective role of Sortilin sorting against protein misfolding and prion-related spreading that might include internalization of other proteins than just Tau and PrP. Along with aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), Tau pathology is also a hallmark of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) [269]. Haploinsufficiency for GRN, a gene encoding progranulin (PGRN) that is a protein with widespread neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory functions, is one possible causative for FTD [270\",\n",

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, is a significant contributor to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Castro et al., 2019).\n",

      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer’s disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. Mutations in presenilin disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production and contributing to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Yang et al., 2024). Furthermore, genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Yang et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. The dysregulation of these processes due to altered gamma-secretase activity can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Yang et al., 2024). Additionally, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Yang et al., 2024).\n",

Single and long-term daily dosing studies demonstrated dose-dependent increases in CSF A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 and corresponding decreases in CSF A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 without changes in total A\\u03b2. However, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, indicating liver toxicity, were also observed, and further development of BMS-932,481 was discontinued [72]. In the previous year, one of the oxidative products of BMS-932,481 was identified as the primary metabolite found in rat and human liver microsomes [73]. The authors hypothesized that the conversion of BMS-932,481 to this metabolite, in which an alcohol was substituted at the C-5 position, led to the formation of reactive species which could result in liver injury. Development of GSM derivatives from this group focused on blocking the metabolism at the C-5 position have yet to be reported. A collaboration between the University of California San Diego and Massachusetts General Hospital synthesized and characterized a series of pyridazine-derived GSM analogs [74]. The top candidate UCSD-776,890 reduced A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 in a dose-dependent manner across acute, subchronic, and chronic dosing studies in multiple species. In prophylactic and disease-modifying regimens administered to 3 and 6\\u00a0month AD transgenic mice respectively, UCSD-776,890 reduced plasma and brain A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 as well as amyloid deposition and microgliosis. Additionally, based on comparison of systemic exposure the compound at 50% effective equivalent human dose is expected to have over a 130-fold safety margin. These studies demonstrate the possibility for small molecule GSMs to be safely administered as secondary prevention in genetically predisposed subjects, or at-risk subjects who are amyloid-positive based on PET imaging. UCSD-776,890 is currently being prepared for phase I studies. The ability to image amyloid and CSF biomarkers in human subjects has been crucial to monitoring the progress of clinical trials in AD [75]. A PET radiotracer based on pyridazine-derived GSM BPN-15606 demonstrated good brain uptake and selectivity for imaging PS1/ \\u03b3-secretase in brains of AD transgenic mice [76]. Elevated brain uptake in AD mice was observed in several critical regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, and mid-brain compared to wild-type mice. Interestingly, imaging studies in the brains of rodents and nonhuman primates revealed overlapping areas of higher uptake, pointing to conservation of \\u03b3-secretase activity. The GSM-based probe is a valuable molecular imaging tool which can be applied to further investigate physiological \\u03b3-secretase structure\\u2013function and potentially optimized as a radiotracer in AD patients. For many years, structural and functional insights of \\u03b3-secretase came from chemical probes derived from GSIs and GSMs [57, 77]. Photoaffinity labeling (PAL) has been a valuable tool for target identification of small molecules [78]. Photoaffinity probes, or photoprobes, contain a photoreactive group which crosslinks to binding targets upon UV irradiation and a reporter tag which enables purification or monitoring of the target. The alkyne handle has been the primary choice for reporter tag due to the ability to \\u201cclick\\u201d on a biotin or fluorophore group using Cu-catalyzed\",\n",

Modifying any of the heterocycles on E2012 could improve binding affinity and/or selectivity for imidazole-like GSMs. GSMs bind to multiple allosteric sites on \\u03b3-secretase, which in turn may alter conformation of the active site (Fig.\\u00a09B) [85]. While these structural studies will need to be supported by experimental data, they can be applied towards rational design of the next generation GSIs and GSMs for AD therapeutics. While targeting \\u03b3-secretase has proven challenging, it should not diminish its potential as a crucial target for AD pathogenesis. The serious toxicities that halted clinical studies of GSIs demonstrated there were many knowledge gaps about \\u03b3-secretase biology and underestimation of its nuanced proteolysis before the compounds were evaluated in humans [49]. GSMs aim to stimulate \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s carboxypeptidase-like trimming of A\\u03b2 peptides to their shorter, less pathogenic forms. Over the past two decades, industry and academic groups have optimized the potency and CNS penetration of GSMs, several of which have started clinical trials. The success of small molecule GSMs, as with other A\\u03b2-targeted therapies, also depend on being administered in the early stages of AD pathology well before clinical manifestations. Amyloid-based biomarkers and diagnostics will be vital to identifying and monitoring trial subjects. The development of the first GSM-based radiotracer suggests that that \\u03b3-secretase expression could be monitored in AD patients. In the past several years, detailed structures of \\u03b3-secretase have emerged. These structures have already been used in computational docking studies for GSMs [91]. Modeling GSMs with varying chemotypes could be insightful for comparing their mechanisms of recognizing and altering substrate and enzyme transmembrane domains. The latest \\u03b3-secretase structures bound to GSIs and E2012 offer a wealth of information for the design and lead optimization of more potent and substrate-selective small molecules. Drug combinations using drugs which act on distinct targets or show different mechanisms of action have been commonly been used in cancer [92]. A few combination therapies could involve (1) distinct structural classes of GSMs (2) GSMs and inhibitors of tau in neurofibrillary tangles, and (3) GSMs and agents which stimulate A\\u03b2 clearance.

While the FDA approved aducanumab, the first A\\u03b2-targeted therapy, multiple safe and effective treatments will be needed to target the complex pathologies of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that is critical for the generation of A\\u03b2 peptides. Activity and specificity of \\u03b3-secretase are regulated by both obligatory subunits and modulatory proteins. Due to its complex structure and function and early clinical failures with pan inhibitors, \\u03b3-secretase has been a challenging drug target for AD. \\u03b3-secretase modulators, however, have dramatically shifted the approach to targeting \\u03b3-secretase.

We also discuss the chemical biology of \\u03b3-secretase, in which small molecule probes enabled structural and functional insights into \\u03b3-secretase before the emergence of high-resolution structural studies. Finally, we discuss the recent crystal structures of \\u03b3-secretase, which have provided valuable perspectives on substrate recognition and molecular mechanisms of small molecules. We conclude that modulation of \\u03b3-secretase will be part of a new wave of AD therapeutics.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia affecting more than 6 million Americans. In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4]. While the underlying disease mechanisms are complex and still being elucidated, multiple lines of evidence support the \\u201camyloid hypothesis,\\u201d which posits that the accumulation of A\\u03b2 peptides initiates a chain of pathological events, including formation of neurofibrillary tangles and inflammatory responses, leading to widespread neurodegeneration and ultimately AD [5, 6].

The presented two-substrate mechanism can explain how disruptions in the optimal balance between \\u03b3-secretase activity and A\\u03b2 metabolism can lead to toxic events in all different sporadic and FAD cases of the disease (Figure 9). A well-defined molecular mechanism that can connect different causes of the disease is crucial for the development of effective early diagnostic tools and drugs [19]. Drug development studies were among the first to indicate that \\u03b3-secretase has two substrate-binding sites [8,9,12,17,30]. Here, we show that the second substrate can affect the sites that bind different drugs (Supplementary Video S3). Such results are consistent with previous studies showing that a gradual increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate can affect how \\u03b3-secretase responds to drugs [6,7,9,11,12]. Drugs can lead to increases in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate [9,89]. Drugs, just like increasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase, can affect the A\\u03b2 (x-42)/A\\u03b2 (x-40) ratio [11,13]. FAD mutations can affect how drugs bind to \\u03b3-secretase [7,10]. Drugs, FAD mutations, and the second substrate can affect the most dynamic parts in the presenilin structure that control processive catalysis (Supplementary Videos S3 and S4). The presented insights indicate that the first possible improvement in future drug development strategies could be the development of competitive inhibitors of \\u03b3-secretase [19]. These competitive inhibitors could mimic the effects of the protective A673T mutation, i.e., decreasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate [15,19]. Attempts to design competitive inhibitors that target the active site have been challenging. The attempts to target the active site with peptide analogs have been unsuccessful due to the surprisingly long and flexible active site tunnel [8,9,12,23]. Our results indicate three alternative strategies for the development of competitive inhibitors: First, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to facilitate the closure of the nicastrin ectodomain (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). Second, the competitive inhibitors could compete with the formation of \\u03b2-secretase\\u2013\\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 8). Third, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules and control its dimerization ([33,34,37] and Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 7). The development of compounds that target C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules is extremely difficult [39]. C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP has a highly dynamic structure and, thus, represents a poorly defined target for effective drug development efforts (Figure 1 and Figure 2 [33,34,37]). The prepared drugs have to compete with other molecules that bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP with high affinity ([37] and Figure 1C). The second major improvement in drug development strategies could be an expansion of the future target list. Compounds that can decrease the catalytic capacity of \\u03b3-secretase can be used to trace different physiological processes that control \\u03b3-secretase activity and amyloid metabolism at pre-symptomatic stages of the disease (Figure 9). Briefly, compounds such as semagacestat and avagacestat can be used in healthy animals to gradually induce pathogenesis, by provoking gradual saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate (Figure 9 [7,9]). The induced pathogenic events can be used for the description of physiological processes that control cellular\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4.

We analyze the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate using multiscale molecular dynamics studies. We found that an increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate could result in the parallel binding of different substrate molecules at the docking site and the active site. The C-terminal domain of the substrate bound at the docking site can interact with the most dynamic presenilin sites at the cytosolic end of the active site tunnel. Such interactions can inhibit the ongoing catalytic activity and increase the production of the longer, more hydrophobic, and more toxic A\\u03b2 proteins. Similar disruptions in dynamic presenilin structures can be observed with different drugs and disease-causing mutations. Both, C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and its different A\\u03b2 products, can support the toxic aggregation. The aggregation depends on the substrate N-terminal domain. Thus, the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b2-secretase path can be more toxic than the C83-\\u03b1CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b1-secretase path. Nicastrin can control the toxic aggregation in the closed conformation. The binding of the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate to \\u03b3-secretase can be controlled by substrate channeling between the nicastrin and \\u03b2-secretase.

Cerebral neurodegeneration typically takes place first in the hippocampus, a region below the neocortex that is critical for consolidating long-term memories. Neuronal loss spreads to other cortical areas, leading to progressive cognitive decline. By the end stages of the disease, patients lose cognitive function to the point of requiring constant care, often institutionalized. Although a number of risk factors have been associated with AD, disease onset correlates best with age, and the large majority of cases occur in the elderly. Among people over age 85, over a third are afflicted. Two types of protein deposits are found in the AD brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2]. The former are extraneuronal and primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), whereas the latter are intraneuronal filaments of the normally microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuroinflammation is a third pathological feature of AD, in which microglia\\u2014phagocytic brain immune cells that release cytokines\\u2014become overactivated [3]. The role of each of these features in AD etiology and pathogenesis are not well understood. However, A\\u03b2 aggregation\\u2014in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques\\u2014is generally observed as the earliest pathology, followed by tau tangle formation and neurodegeneration [4]. For this reason and those mentioned in the next section, pathological A\\u03b2 is widely considered the initiator of AD, triggering downstream tau pathology and neuroinflammation, and A\\u03b2 has been the primary target for the development of AD therapeutics for over 25 years [5].

Interestingly, mutations in PS1 change the localization toward that of PS2-containing complexes (67). After the discovery of \\u03b3-secretase, a huge amount of research was carried out to develop potent and bioavailable \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), but the clinical trials based on these inhibitors all failed (Table\\u00a01). Indeed, none of them led to improvement of AD-linked cognitive decline and even sometimes they worsened them. In most of these trials, A\\u03b2 levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly decreased, thus clearly indicating that a reduction in total A\\u03b2 was not sufficient to restore cognitive function. This was the case for Semagacestat, the first GSI tested in late-stage clinical trials for AD, which was reported to reduce A\\u03b2 levels by more than 60% in the plasma (110), and new A\\u03b2 synthesis was decreased by more than 80% in CSF (111). More alarming, many trials were readily stopped because of increased risk of developing skin cancer and infections, which was supposed to be tightly linked to a defective Notch signaling in the presence of the inhibitors (112). Therefore, several groups started to screen for drugs having a higher affinity for APP than toward Notch, such as Avagacestat, initially reported to be 140-fold more selective for APP than Notch (113), although its Notch sparing ability remains controversial (114, 115). Avagacestat led to a 40% A\\u03b2 reduction in CSF (Table\\u00a01), but demonstrated similar side effects in clinical trials (116). Therefore, due to the huge number of different \\u03b3-secretase substrates, it has appeared difficult to target specifically and exclusively the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated APP cleavage. Furthermore, data from preclinical trials proposed that the lack of efficacy, or even worsening, of cognitive function in these trials was also linked to the progressive accumulation of APP-CTFs in the presence of GSIs (117). To avoid such effects, therapeutic development became focused on \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that were expected to be safer, since they interact with \\u03b3-secretase complex through the allosteric binding site, thereby modifying the enzyme activity but not blocking it (118). The concept of \\u03b3-secretase modulation was discovered with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, which are considered as GSMs, because they induce conformational changes in PS1 and shift the cleavage of C99 toward shorter A\\u03b2 species such as A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 (16, 119). In that way, GSMs do not lead to increased APP-CTFs levels. Indeed, in AD animal models, the chronic treatment with GSMs did not lead to the worsening of cognitive function observed with GSIs (117). Moreover, GSMs are also safer because they reduce the level of A\\u03b242 and increase shorter A\\u03b2 peptides without affecting Notch signaling (120, 121). Nonetheless, the first GSMs tested in clinical trials, Rofecoxib (122), Tarenflurbil (123) or Naproxen (124), did not show efficacy, but the lack of effects seemed to be related to a very poor blood\\u2013brain barrier crossing ability of these drugs (Table\\u00a01). Thus, taken together, \\u03b3-secretase-based strategies have so far been unsuccessful, even if GSMs seem to be more promising (125). Still, if considering \\u03b3\",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

GPCRs require adaptor proteins such as arrestins to prevent further G protein-mediated signaling206. \\u03b2-Arrestin1 is highly expressed in the brain206, and \\u03b2-arrestin1 KO mice exhibit reduced A\\u03b2 production and spared Notch cleavage207. \\u03b2-arrestin1 interacts only with Aph-1 in \\u03b3-secretase, and overexpression of \\u03b2-arrestin1 enhanced mature \\u03b3-secretase complex formation at 440\\u2009kDa207. KO of \\u03b2-arrestin1 in APP/PS1 mice decreased A\\u03b2 production and improved memory deficits207. Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) was also reported to regulate the assembly of \\u03b3-secretase complexes and contribute to A\\u03b2 pathogenesis208. SERP1 interacts with the Aph-1a/Nct subcomplex of \\u03b3-secretase and increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 generation but reduces Notch processing208. Recently, IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3, also known as fragilis) was identified as an imidazole GSM, E2012, binding protein158. Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211. Hur et al.158 showed that IFITM3 binds to PS1-NTF in active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production (A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242) (Fig. 6). KD or KO of IFITM3 decreased A\\u03b2 production, and overexpression of IFITM3 increased A\\u03b2 levels in IFITM3 KO cells158. Moreover, crossing IFITM3 KO mice with 5XFAD Tg mice decreased A\\u03b2 production and amyloid plaque formation in the cortex and hippocampus158. Aging mouse models also showed increased IFITM3 levels, \\u03b3-secretase activity, and active IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase complex formation levels by aging158. A positive correlation between the amount of active IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase complexes and the high \\u03b3-secretase activity resulting in high A\\u03b2 production was shown in the subsets of SAD patient\",\n",

Mutations in the transmembrane domain of amyloid \\u03b2-protein precursor (APP) associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) can alter the ratio of aggregation-prone 42-residue A\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242) to 40-residue A\\u03b2 (A\\u03b240). However, APP substrate is proteolyzed processively by \\u03b3-secretase along two pathways: A\\u03b249\\u2192A\\u03b246\\u2192A\\u03b243\\u2192A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b248\\u2192A\\u03b245\\u2192A\\u03b242\\u2192A\\u03b238. Effects of FAD mutations on each proteolytic step are unknown, largely due to difficulties in detecting and quantifying longer A\\u03b2 peptides. To address this, we carried out systematic and quantitative analyses of all tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts from proteolysis of wild-type and 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by purified \\u03b3-secretase. These small peptides, including FAD-mutant forms, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by establishing concentration curves for each of 32 standards. APP intracellular domain (AICD) coproducts were quantified by immunoblot, and the ratio of AICD products corresponding to A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 was determined by mass spectrometry. Levels of individual A\\u03b2 peptides were determined by subtracting levels of peptide coproducts associated with degradation from those associated with production. This method was validated for A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 by specific ELISAs and production of equimolar levels of A\\u03b2 and AICD. Not all mutant substrates led to increased A\\u03b242/40. However, all 14 disease-causing mutations led to inefficient processing of longer forms of A\\u03b2 \\u2265 45 residues. In addition, the effects of certain mutations provided insight into the mechanism of processive proteolysis: intermediate A\\u03b2 peptides apparently remain bound for subsequent trimming and are not released and reassociated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nCerebral plaques composed of the amyloid \\u03b2-protein (A\\u03b2) are a defining pathological feature of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (1). A\\u03b2 is produced from the amyloid \\u03b2-protein precursor (APP) through sequential proteolysis, by \\u03b2-secretase shedding the ectodomain (2) followed by \\u03b3-secretase cutting within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the remnant 99-residue C-terminal fragment (C99) (3). A\\u03b2 peptides of 38 to 43 residues are secreted, with the aggregation-prone 42-residue form (A\\u03b242) being predominantly and disproportionally deposited in AD plaques (4).

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced.

The GSAS represent, in theory, a precision medicine approach to the prevention of amyloid deposition, as they specifically target a discrete aspect in a complex cell biological signalling mechanism that initiates the pathological processes leading to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The various A\\u03b2 species, 37\\u201343 amino acids in length, are generated from the C99 fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2), the catalytic subunits of the intramembrane\\u2010cleaving protease \\u03b3\\u2010secretase 2. Following an initial cleavage of the C99 transmembrane domain at the \\u03b5\\u2010site, which releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and gives rise to A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248, further stepwise carboxy\\u2010terminal cleavages occur 2.

Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a), but kinetic modeling combined with informative site-directed mutagenesis will be important to fully unravel the function of these remarkable structures (Bhattarai et al, 2022; Chen et al, 2023; Petit et al, 2022b).

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242.

Collectively, these data assign a defining role to the N-terminal region of A\\u03b2 in the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity.

      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Luo & Li, 2022). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Luo & Li, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Luo & Li, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Svedružić et al., 2023). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Luo & Li, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Luo & Li, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma-secretase have faced challenges, as seen with the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat and avagacestat due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in patients (Luo & Li, 2022). However, ongoing research into the role of gamma-secretase in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction continues to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. The use of biomarkers, such as CSF Aβ levels, has also been investigated for their utility in assessing drug-target engagement in clinical settings (Svedružić et al., 2023). Additionally, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity through selective inhibitors or modulators may provide a pathway for therapeutic intervention while minimizing side effects (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "Effective treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease may require a nuanced approach to modulating gamma-secretase activity. This includes the development of substrate-specific inhibitors that can reduce toxic Aβ production while preserving essential functions of the gamma-secretase complex (Luo & Li, 2022). Additionally, exploring gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to correct presenilin mutations offers a promising avenue for future therapies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression (Svedružić et al., 2023). The integration of findings linking Aβ42 levels and gamma-secretase inhibition into therapeutic strategies could provide new insights into managing AD effectively (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017).

Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

The role of A\\u03b2 in AD etiology was further confirmed by the discovery few years later of the first mutations in presenilins that were found to be involved in A\\u03b2\\u00a0production and, similarly to APP mutations, seemed to exacerbate A\\u03b2 accumulation in cells, animal models as well as in AD-affected human brains (14, 15, 16). A last, but very important genetic evidence of a key role of A\\u03b2 in AD etiology was the recent findings of the Icelandic APP mutation that was shown to be protective by reducing cognitive decline and A\\u03b2 load by about\\u00a040% (17). Thus, this set of histopathological, genetic, and biochemical data concurred to support the view that A\\u03b2 accumulation could be the etiological cause of the pathology, as stated in the amyloid cascade hypothesis that was proposed in 1992 by Hardy and Higgings (18). Indeed, mutations in three distinct proteins, namely APP, PS1, and PS2, are all responsible for FAD and have in common to modulate both APP processing and A\\u03b2 production. In this context, one can understand the huge efforts aimed at determining the mechanisms and enzymes involved in A\\u03b2 production and designing potent, specific, and bioavailable inhibitors of these enzymes (19, 20) or A\\u03b2 neutralizing antibodies. However, until so far, the outcomes of these A\\u03b2-centered strategies have been extremely disappointing in our quest for meaningful treatments (21, 22) (Table\\u00a01). This has led to question the validity of the amyloid cascade hypothesis (23) or to discuss in a more cautious and balanced manner the ins, outs, and limitations of the procedures of clinical trials (24). It remains that before \\u201cthrowing out the baby and the bath water,\\u201d one should try to reconcile undoubted genetic evidences linking APP processing to AD and failures of A\\u03b2-based clinical trials. In this context, a way to reconcile these observations could be to envisage the possible contribution of other APP-derived fragments distinct from A\\u03b2 itself to AD pathology. Indeed, growing evidence proposes that the direct precursor of A\\u03b2 (see below), the \\u03b2-secretase-derived fragment, C99, could be an early and main contributor to AD. Thus, in this review, we address the possibility that the failure of A\\u03b2-centric clinical trials could be explained, at least partly, by their lack of effect on C99. To go further, we describe clues and evidences suggesting that \\u03b3-secretase should be considered as a beneficial C99-inactivating enzyme and argument against therapeutic strategies targeting this enzyme. We instead propose alternative strategies seeking to circumvent C99 accumulation, which would then have the advantage to reduce both C99 and A\\u03b2 levels.Table\\u00a01Principal antiamyloid clinical drugs and strategiesStrategyDrug/specific targetA\\u03b2 modulation in treated AD patientsFDA statute and participantsSide effects/cognitive readoutReferenceActive immunotherapyAN-1792 (synthetic A\\u03b242, Janssen)\\u2265 60\\u201370% A\\u03b2 load reduction in the brain (post-mortem immonustaining)Discontinued in 2002 (mild to moderate AD patients)Meningoencephalitis(208)(209)(210)CAD106 (multiple copies of A\\u03b21-6 peptide, Novartis)1.3% A\\u03b2 reduction in brain PET scan (florbetapir)2\\u20133-fold increase in plasma\",\n",

The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015).

Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) is triggering the disease. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavages of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase.

The lack of a precise understanding of A\\u03b2 generation as well as of the functions of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key AD drug target in the past few years. Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the \\u03b3-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes \\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP into different A\\u03b2 species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of A\\u03b242/43. Finally, we discuss how the knowledge emerging from these studies could be used to therapeutically target this enzyme in a safe way.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u00b4s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide currently affecting about 47 millions people. The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3.

Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD.

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Luo & Li, 2022). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Luo & Li, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Luo & Li, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Svedružić et al., 2023). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Luo & Li, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Luo & Li, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",

Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a), but kinetic modeling combined with informative site-directed mutagenesis will be important to fully unravel the function of these remarkable structures (Bhattarai et al, 2022; Chen et al, 2023; Petit et al, 2022b).

We analyze the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate using multiscale molecular dynamics studies. We found that an increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate could result in the parallel binding of different substrate molecules at the docking site and the active site. The C-terminal domain of the substrate bound at the docking site can interact with the most dynamic presenilin sites at the cytosolic end of the active site tunnel. Such interactions can inhibit the ongoing catalytic activity and increase the production of the longer, more hydrophobic, and more toxic A\\u03b2 proteins. Similar disruptions in dynamic presenilin structures can be observed with different drugs and disease-causing mutations. Both, C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and its different A\\u03b2 products, can support the toxic aggregation. The aggregation depends on the substrate N-terminal domain. Thus, the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b2-secretase path can be more toxic than the C83-\\u03b1CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b1-secretase path. Nicastrin can control the toxic aggregation in the closed conformation. The binding of the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate to \\u03b3-secretase can be controlled by substrate channeling between the nicastrin and \\u03b2-secretase. We conclude that the presented two-substrate mechanism could explain the pathogenic changes in \\u03b3-secretase activity and A\\u03b2 metabolism in different sporadic and familial cases of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Future drug-development efforts should target different cellular mechanisms that regulate the optimal balance between \\u03b3-secretase activity and amyloid metabolism.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease is a slowly progressing and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder [1,2]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease stands out among other malignant diseases as imposing the greatest financial burden on healthcare providers in developed countries [1,3,4]. Impressive drug development efforts have been mostly centered on the metabolism of the last 99 amino acids of the amyloid precursor protein (C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP) [3,4]. Based on strong genetic results, the most frequent therapeutic targets are two aspartic proteases: membrane-anchored \\u03b2-secretase, and membrane-embedded \\u03b3-secretase [2,3,5]. A number of different compounds have been developed. Compounds with different structures, different binding sites, different mechanisms of action, and different pharmacological properties have shown very impressive nanomolar potency [1,4,5]. This impressive list of diverse and potent compounds has not produced the desired results, but it clearly shows that the present challenges extend beyond routine medicinal chemistry. It appears that we need to address some unique features in the enzymatic mechanisms of \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase before we can develop successful drug design strategies [4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14].

Cerebral neurodegeneration typically takes place first in the hippocampus, a region below the neocortex that is critical for consolidating long-term memories. Neuronal loss spreads to other cortical areas, leading to progressive cognitive decline. By the end stages of the disease, patients lose cognitive function to the point of requiring constant care, often institutionalized. Although a number of risk factors have been associated with AD, disease onset correlates best with age, and the large majority of cases occur in the elderly. Among people over age 85, over a third are afflicted. Two types of protein deposits are found in the AD brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2]. The former are extraneuronal and primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), whereas the latter are intraneuronal filaments of the normally microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuroinflammation is a third pathological feature of AD, in which microglia\\u2014phagocytic brain immune cells that release cytokines\\u2014become overactivated [3]. The role of each of these features in AD etiology and pathogenesis are not well understood. However, A\\u03b2 aggregation\\u2014in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques\\u2014is generally observed as the earliest pathology, followed by tau tangle formation and neurodegeneration [4]. For this reason and those mentioned in the next section, pathological A\\u03b2 is widely considered the initiator of AD, triggering downstream tau pathology and neuroinflammation, and A\\u03b2 has been the primary target for the development of AD therapeutics for over 25 years [5]. As mentioned above, the \\u201camyloid hypothesis\\u201d of AD pathogenesis has reigned for decades, and AD drug development has largely focused on inhibiting A\\u03b2\",\n",

Protein Data Bank entry 7D8X Superimposing the E2012-bound \\u03b3-secretase structure in complex with an APP fragment revealed that the flurophenyl and piperidine groups clashed with APP transmembrane domain. Modifying any of the heterocycles on E2012 could improve binding affinity and/or selectivity for imidazole-like GSMs. GSMs bind to multiple allosteric sites on \\u03b3-secretase, which in turn may alter conformation of the active site (Fig.\\u00a09B) [85]. While these structural studies will need to be supported by experimental data, they can be applied towards rational design of the next generation GSIs and GSMs for AD therapeutics. While targeting \\u03b3-secretase has proven challenging, it should not diminish its potential as a crucial target for AD pathogenesis. The serious toxicities that halted clinical studies of GSIs demonstrated there were many knowledge gaps about \\u03b3-secretase biology and underestimation of its nuanced proteolysis before the compounds were evaluated in humans [49]. GSMs aim to stimulate \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s carboxypeptidase-like trimming of A\\u03b2 peptides to their shorter, less pathogenic forms. Over the past two decades, industry and academic groups have optimized the potency and CNS penetration of GSMs, several of which have started clinical trials. The success of small molecule GSMs, as with other A\\u03b2-targeted therapies, also depend on being administered in the early stages of AD pathology well before clinical manifestations. Amyloid-based biomarkers and diagnostics will be vital to identifying and monitoring trial subjects. The development of the first GSM-based radiotracer suggests that that \\u03b3-secretase expression could be monitored in AD patients. In the past several years, detailed structures of \\u03b3-secretase have emerged. These structures have already been used in computational docking studies for GSMs [91]. Modeling GSMs with varying chemotypes could be insightful for comparing their mechanisms of recognizing and altering substrate and enzyme transmembrane domains. The latest \\u03b3-secretase structures bound to GSIs and E2012 offer a wealth of information for the design and lead optimization of more potent and substrate-selective small molecules. Drug combinations using drugs which act on distinct targets or show different mechanisms of action have been commonly been used in cancer [92]. A few combination therapies could involve (1) distinct structural classes of GSMs (2) GSMs and inhibitors of tau in neurofibrillary tangles, and (3) GSMs and agents which stimulate A\\u03b2 clearance.

Unfortunately, little was learned from the failed trials\\u00a0(De Strooper, 2014), and \\u03b3-secretases were largely deprioritized as drug targets for the industry in the context of AD. Interestingly, the capacity of GSIs to block Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999) remained all this time of interest to companies in the context of cancer and chronic inflammation (McCaw et al, 2021; Christopoulos et al, 2021). Nirogacestat (Ogsiveo) recently became the first GSI to reach regulatory approval for rare desmoid tumors that are non-cancerous growths of the connective tissue (Gounder et al, 2023) (see Box\\u00a01). Recent success with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) in AD have considerably changed the perspective on the potential of A\\u03b2 lowering as a possible therapy for this devastating disorder (Karran et al, 2011; Karran and De Strooper, 2022). However, various aspects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy may not make them the optimal therapeutic choice for primary prevention clinical studies. A possible approach to primary prevention might be the suppression of A\\u03b2 production so that the key A\\u03b2 plaque-seeding peptides are not produced in sufficient concentrations to initiate plaque formation. While inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase or of BACE1, the other protease that is needed to release A\\u03b2 from APP (Fig.\\u00a01), remain formal possibilities, both approaches suffer from the same dilemma: can a therapeutic window be established sparing the normal functions of both enzymes? To administer agents that already carry known adverse events to normal individuals lacks clinical equipoise. Gamma-secretase allosteric stabilizers (GSAS), in contrast to \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), theoretically allow normal physiological processing of the many substrates of the \\u03b3-secretases, while enhancing the processive cleavage of the A\\u03b2 peptide, favouring the generation of shorter forms as we will discuss below. The GSASs avoid the mechanism-based side effects that precluded the clinical development of GSIs and revert the production of all long A\\u03b2 peptides to shorter forms, in contrast to the earlier \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSM) that were directed to A\\u03b242 lowering (Weggen et al, 2001; Luo and Li, 2022). In the first part of this review, we will discuss our current understanding of \\u03b3-secretases and the effect of clinical mutations on their activity, resolving ongoing controversy in the field. We will stress how novel insights from cryo-EM structures (Yang et al, 2021) and a better understanding of function\\u00a0(Petit et al, 2022a; Szaruga et al, 2017) and cell biology (Sannerud et al, 2016) of the \\u03b3-secretases have allowed insights into the mode of action of GSASs. In the second part of the review, we will use these insights to explain the mode of action of GSASs and to discuss the roadblocks to further clinical development of GSAS-based precision medicine approaches for the prevention of AD. One of the major aims of the therapeutic development of GSIs in AD was to separate Notch from APP processing. The putative Notch sparing inhibitor avagacestat (Coric et al, 2015) made it to a phase-II clinical trial but was halted because of Notch and other side effects.

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4].

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Luo & Li, 2022). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Luo & Li, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Luo & Li, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Svedružić et al., 2023). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Luo & Li, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Luo & Li, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",

The role of A\\u03b2 in AD etiology was further confirmed by the discovery few years later of the first mutations in presenilins that were found to be involved in A\\u03b2\\u00a0production and, similarly to APP mutations, seemed to exacerbate A\\u03b2 accumulation in cells, animal models as well as in AD-affected human brains (14, 15, 16). A last, but very important genetic evidence of a key role of A\\u03b2 in AD etiology was the recent findings of the Icelandic APP mutation that was shown to be protective by reducing cognitive decline and A\\u03b2 load by about\\u00a040% (17). Thus, this set of histopathological, genetic, and biochemical data concurred to support the view that A\\u03b2 accumulation could be the etiological cause of the pathology, as stated in the amyloid cascade hypothesis that was proposed in 1992 by Hardy and Higgings (18). Indeed, mutations in three distinct proteins, namely APP, PS1, and PS2, are all responsible for FAD and have in common to modulate both APP processing and A\\u03b2 production. In this context, one can understand the huge efforts aimed at determining the mechanisms and enzymes involved in A\\u03b2 production and designing potent, specific, and bioavailable inhibitors of these enzymes (19, 20) or A\\u03b2 neutralizing antibodies. However, until so far, the outcomes of these A\\u03b2-centered strategies have been extremely disappointing in our quest for meaningful treatments (21, 22) (Table\\u00a01). This has led to question the validity of the amyloid cascade hypothesis (23) or to discuss in a more cautious and balanced manner the ins, outs, and limitations of the procedures of clinical trials (24). It remains that before \\u201cthrowing out the baby and the bath water,\\u201d one should try to reconcile undoubted genetic evidences linking APP processing to AD and failures of A\\u03b2-based clinical trials. In this context, a way to reconcile these observations could be to envisage the possible contribution of other APP-derived fragments distinct from A\\u03b2 itself to AD pathology. Indeed, growing evidence proposes that the direct precursor of A\\u03b2 (see below), the \\u03b2-secretase-derived fragment, C99, could be an early and main contributor to AD. Thus, in this review, we address the possibility that the failure of A\\u03b2-centric clinical trials could be explained, at least partly, by their lack of effect on C99. To go further, we describe clues and evidences suggesting that \\u03b3-secretase should be considered as a beneficial C99-inactivating enzyme and argument against therapeutic strategies targeting this enzyme. We instead propose alternative strategies seeking to circumvent C99 accumulation, which would then have the advantage to reduce both C99 and A\\u03b2 levels.Table\\u00a01Principal antiamyloid clinical drugs and strategiesStrategyDrug/specific targetA\\u03b2 modulation in treated AD patientsFDA statute and participantsSide effects/cognitive readoutReferenceActive immunotherapyAN-1792 (synthetic A\\u03b242, Janssen)\\u2265 60\\u201370% A\\u03b2 load reduction in the brain (post-mortem immonustaining)Discontinued in 2002 (mild to moderate AD patients)Meningoencephalitis(208)(209)(210)CAD106 (multiple copies of A\\u03b21-6 peptide, Novartis)1.3% A\\u03b2 reduction in brain PET scan (florbetapir)2\\u20133-fold increase in plasma\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

Until so far, no mutations have been found in \\u03b2-secretase, but the Swedish and the Leuven APP mutations are known to shift the cleavage from the \\u03b2\\u2032-site to the \\u03b2-site, thus leading to a much higher C99 and A\\u03b2 production (12, 13, 37, 38). Inversely, the Icelandic mutation (A673T) seems to be protective against AD by decreasing \\u03b2-secretase cleavage and thus reducing by 40% the amyloidogenic fragments sAPP\\u03b2 and A\\u03b2 (17, 39). The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50). Further studies also revealed a very complex cleavage of APP-CTFs by \\u03b3-secretase, since it takes place within the membrane and successively at several sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6-, \\u03b3- and \\u03b3\\u2032).

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

Interestingly, mutations in PS1 change the localization toward that of PS2-containing complexes (67). After the discovery of \\u03b3-secretase, a huge amount of research was carried out to develop potent and bioavailable \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), but the clinical trials based on these inhibitors all failed (Table\\u00a01). Indeed, none of them led to improvement of AD-linked cognitive decline and even sometimes they worsened them. In most of these trials, A\\u03b2 levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly decreased, thus clearly indicating that a reduction in total A\\u03b2 was not sufficient to restore cognitive function. This was the case for Semagacestat, the first GSI tested in late-stage clinical trials for AD, which was reported to reduce A\\u03b2 levels by more than 60% in the plasma (110), and new A\\u03b2 synthesis was decreased by more than 80% in CSF (111). More alarming, many trials were readily stopped because of increased risk of developing skin cancer and infections, which was supposed to be tightly linked to a defective Notch signaling in the presence of the inhibitors (112). Therefore, several groups started to screen for drugs having a higher affinity for APP than toward Notch, such as Avagacestat, initially reported to be 140-fold more selective for APP than Notch (113), although its Notch sparing ability remains controversial (114, 115). Avagacestat led to a 40% A\\u03b2 reduction in CSF (Table\\u00a01), but demonstrated similar side effects in clinical trials (116). Therefore, due to the huge number of different \\u03b3-secretase substrates, it has appeared difficult to target specifically and exclusively the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated APP cleavage. Furthermore, data from preclinical trials proposed that the lack of efficacy, or even worsening, of cognitive function in these trials was also linked to the progressive accumulation of APP-CTFs in the presence of GSIs (117). To avoid such effects, therapeutic development became focused on \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that were expected to be safer, since they interact with \\u03b3-secretase complex through the allosteric binding site, thereby modifying the enzyme activity but not blocking it (118). The concept of \\u03b3-secretase modulation was discovered with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, which are considered as GSMs, because they induce conformational changes in PS1 and shift the cleavage of C99 toward shorter A\\u03b2 species such as A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 (16, 119). In that way, GSMs do not lead to increased APP-CTFs levels. Indeed, in AD animal models, the chronic treatment with GSMs did not lead to the worsening of cognitive function observed with GSIs (117). Moreover, GSMs are also safer because they reduce the level of A\\u03b242 and increase shorter A\\u03b2 peptides without affecting Notch signaling (120, 121). Nonetheless, the first GSMs tested in clinical trials, Rofecoxib (122), Tarenflurbil (123) or Naproxen (124), did not show efficacy, but the lack of effects seemed to be related to a very poor blood\\u2013brain barrier crossing ability of these drugs (Table\\u00a01). Thus, taken together, \\u03b3-secretase-based strategies have so far been unsuccessful, even if GSMs seem to be more promising (125). Still, if considering \\u03b3\",\n",

There\\u2019s debate over whether amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2) plaques or PSEN dysfunction triggers neurodegeneration. The \\\"presenilin first\\\" hypothesis is challenged since conditional knockouts of PSEN do not produce amyloid plaques. Gamma-secretase cleaves APP, beginning with \\u03b5-cleavage to release intracellular domains crucial for signaling. This mechanism underlines the connection between synaptic dysfunction and AD, with disturbances in neuronal membrane functions implicated in cognitive decline.\\n\\n7\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \" consensus view is that the mutations cause a partial loss of PSEN function (Baumeister et al, 1997; De Strooper, 2007; Wolfe, 2007; Sun et al, 2017; Szaruga et al, 2015; Shen and Kelleher, 2007; Baumeister et al, 1997) and affect APP processing. The question of how this loss of function leads to AD remains, however, a contentious issue. The underlying conundrum is whether A\\u03b2 peptide and amyloid plaques are sufficient to trigger AD (\\u201camyloid first\\u201d) (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Karran et al, 2011), or whether PSEN dysfunction itself is the cause of neuronal dyshomeostasis and neurodegeneration (\\u201cpresenilin first\\u201d) (Shen and Kelleher, 2007). The latter hypothesis aligns with a school of thought that has criticized the amyloid hypothesis for AD and the idea that A\\u03b2 is the trigger of the disease. The \\u201cpresenilin first\\u201d hypothesis is, however, largely based on experiments in conditional knock-out forebrain neurons or interneurons with total loss of PSEN1. This leads indeed to progressive neurodegeneration (Zhang et al, 2009; Xia et al, 2015; Watanabe et al, 2014), but in none of these conditions are amyloid plaques or neuronal tangles observed. Moreover, conditional knockouts of the other subunits of \\u03b3-secretase, i.e., Ncstn (Tabuchi et al, 2009) and Aph1a and b (Acx et al, 2017), mutations of which have not been associated with FAD, cause similar neurodegeneration. Membrane-bound fragments generated from App, Aplp1, Nrg1, Dcc, and other \\u03b3-secretase substrates (Acx et al, 2017) accumulate >10-fold in the targeted neurons. It is no surprise that this leads to severe disturbances of neuronal membrane functions, including synaptic transmission. Clearly, the \\u201cpresenilin first\\u201d hypothesis fails to provide a consistent explanation for the neuropathology that characterizes FAD patients. Importantly, the loss-of-function mutations causing FAD are not null mutations and they always target the enzymatically active PSEN subunit. Gamma-secretases cleave their substrates in two steps (Quintero-Monzon et al, 2011). The first endoproteolytic cleavage occurs close to the cytoplasmic side of the transmembrane domain and is referred to as the \\u03b5-cleavage. This is the cleavage that releases the intracellular domains of APP, Notch, and other substrates and enables intracellular signaling (Jurisch-Yaksi et al, 2013) (Fig.\\u00a01). The remaining A\\u03b248/49 is further trimmed by consecutive \\u03b3-cleavages that progressively shorten the membrane-bound part of A\\u03b2 until it is released into the extracellular space (Takami et al, 2009). Every cleavage step requires the progressive unwinding of the transmembrane helix, the reengagement of the catalytic site, and the formation of a new enzyme-substrate complex. Recent structural studies show how APP is anchored in the complex via an induced mixed \\u03b2-sheet structure formed between the carboxyterminal A\\u03b2 region of APP and two additional peptide-strands of PSEN. This positions the cleavage site of the APP substrate into the catalytic site and makes the first \\u03b3-cleavage of APP possible. A partial unwinding of the resulting A\\u03b248/49 is needed to expose the new cleavage site to\",\n",

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

       "</span><span class=\"diff-line\"> Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Luo &amp; Li, 2022). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

       "</span><span class=\"diff-line diff-sub\">-In Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Luo &amp; Li, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Luo & Li, 2022). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Luo & Li, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Checler et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Luo & Li, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Svedružić et al., 2023). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Checler et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Luo & Li, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Luo & Li, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma-secretase have faced challenges, as seen with the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat and avagacestat due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in patients (Luo & Li, 2022). However, ongoing research into the role of gamma-secretase in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction continues to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. The use of biomarkers, such as CSF Aβ levels, has also been investigated for their utility in assessing drug-target engagement in clinical settings (Svedružić et al., 2023). Additionally, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity through selective inhibitors or modulators may provide a pathway for therapeutic intervention while minimizing side effects (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "Effective treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease may require a nuanced approach to modulating gamma-secretase activity. This includes the development of substrate-specific inhibitors that can reduce toxic Aβ production while preserving essential functions of the gamma-secretase complex (Luo & Li, 2022).

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4.

Cerebral neurodegeneration typically takes place first in the hippocampus, a region below the neocortex that is critical for consolidating long-term memories. Neuronal loss spreads to other cortical areas, leading to progressive cognitive decline. By the end stages of the disease, patients lose cognitive function to the point of requiring constant care, often institutionalized. Although a number of risk factors have been associated with AD, disease onset correlates best with age, and the large majority of cases occur in the elderly. Among people over age 85, over a third are afflicted. Two types of protein deposits are found in the AD brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2]. The former are extraneuronal and primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), whereas the latter are intraneuronal filaments of the normally microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuroinflammation is a third pathological feature of AD, in which microglia\\u2014phagocytic brain immune cells that release cytokines\\u2014become overactivated [3]. The role of each of these features in AD etiology and pathogenesis are not well understood. However, A\\u03b2 aggregation\\u2014in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques\\u2014is generally observed as the earliest pathology, followed by tau tangle formation and neurodegeneration [4]. For this reason and those mentioned in the next section, pathological A\\u03b2 is widely considered the initiator of AD, triggering downstream tau pathology and neuroinflammation, and A\\u03b2 has been the primary target for the development of AD therapeutics for over 25 years [5]. As mentioned above, the \\u201camyloid hypothesis\\u201d of AD pathogenesis has reigned for decades, and AD drug development has largely focused on inhibiting A\\u03b2\",\n",

Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a), but kinetic modeling combined with informative site-directed mutagenesis will be important to fully unravel the function of these remarkable structures (Bhattarai et al, 2022; Chen et al, 2023; Petit et al, 2022b).

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

In summary, biochemical studies suggest that distinct GSI and GSM modulation sites exist in PS of the \\u03b3-secretase complex: binding sites for TSA GSI and allosteric GSMs (acid GSM and imidazole GSM, respectively) (Fig. 5)132. These different classes of small molecules occupy different distinctive sites within the \\u03b3-secretase complex. Therefore, they interact and induce conformational changes in \\u03b3-secretase complexes, which lead to different A\\u03b2 cleavages132. For example, E2012-BPyne shows enhanced labeling of PS1-NTF in the presence of GSI L-685,458150. Recently, cryo-EM structure studies confirmed the different binding sites for TSA GSI (L-685,458) and imidazole GSM (E2012) found in the \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig. 5)112. L-685,458 binds the active site of PS1, while the imidazole GSM E2012 binds to the allosteric binding site in PS1112. For a non-TSA GSI, semagacestat occupies the same location as APP (C99) and Notch (N100)112. It suggests that semagacestat could block hybrid \\u03b2 sheet formation between substrates and PS1, therefore inhibiting substrate cleavages112. Another non-TSA GSI (avagacestat) also occupies a similar binding site as semagacestat except with some variations112. L-685,458, semagacestat, and avagacestat share the same binding pocket in PS1, whereas L-685,458 has an additional unique binding pocket112. Co-incubation with L-685,458 and E2012 also showed that E2012 binds to the interface between Nct and PS1 (Fig. 5)112. Yang et al.112 suggested that GSIs and GSMs could be used in combination for a synergistic effect, and this structural information could also improve the design of substrate-selective small molecules for AD. Bateman et al.153 reported that A\\u03b2 production and clearance rates per hour in human CSF are 7.6% and 8.3%, respectively. Sporadic AD (SAD) human brain gray matter has 4.8\\u2009mg more total A\\u03b2 than healthy controls154. This gives the estimated A\\u03b2 accumulation rate in the brain ~28\\u2009ng/hour, and a 2\\u20135% slight increase in A\\u03b2 deposition could lead to AD in ~20 years154. For FAD, PS FAD mutations increase the ratio of A\\u03b242/40, which leads to AD over several decades155. Therefore, reducing A\\u03b2 production by a few percent154 by modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity with GSMs and/or other means could be therapeutic for AD patients. Although PS, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 are essential subunits for \\u03b3-secretase activity50, it is plausible that other transiently binding proteins could regulate \\u03b3-secretase activity and/or substrate specificity in different types of tissues, cells, or subcellular organelles.

Importantly, if loss of \\u03b3-secretase activity by presenilin mutations should be causative for AD, then haploinsufficiency of other \\u03b3-secretase subunits should also cause the disease. However, nonsense mutations that have been identified in PS1, NCT and PEN-2 are implicated in the cause of the rare skin disease acne inversa and not AD 137. Finally, it is obvious that all types of APP FAD mutations as well as the protective Icelandic mutation or the presence of AD in Down syndrome patients with an APP gene triplication are not explainable by the presenilin hypothesis. Taken together, balancing the available evidence, the support of the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains overwhelming, whereas the problems of the presenilin hypothesis persist. Since the amyloid cascade hypothesis predicts that lowering A\\u03b2 should be beneficial for AD, \\u03b3-secretase has been an obvious and major drug target. Thus, to inhibit its enzymatic activity and blocking A\\u03b2 generation, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were developed 138139. They fall into two principal classes, transition-state analogue (TSA) inhibitors, such as the prototypic L-685,458 140 and related compounds as well as non-TSA compounds. The former compounds, which target the catalytic site of \\u03b3-secretase were the first highly potent inhibitors identified. Non-TSA inhibitors such as DAPT 141 or LY450139 (semagacestat) 142 are considered to bind nearby the active site. Unfortunately, since such pan-GSIs inhibit both A\\u03b2 and Notch ICD (NICD) production, severe side effects were observed when administered in vivo, mainly due to disturbance of Notch signaling 143144145146. While this is unwanted for AD therapy, treatment of certain cancers may benefit from Notch pathway inhibition by GSIs 147. Several non-TSA GSIs were reported to have less inhibitory effects on NICD generation at a concentration range at which they sufficiently reduce A\\u03b2 secretion. Such Notch-sparing GSIs, as for example the promising candidate BMS-708163 (avagacestat) 148, were thus considered as improved\",\n",

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Luo & Li, 2022). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Luo & Li, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Checler et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Luo & Li, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Svedružić et al., 2023). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Checler et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Luo & Li, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Luo & Li, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",

PSEN1 mutations are the most common cause of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), with over 300 identified mutations. These mutations impact \\u03b3-secretase activity, essential for A\\u03b2 metabolism, potentially leading to rapidly progressive disease. Key residues, including Asp275 and Asp385, are critical for PSEN1's proteolytic and \\u03b3-secretase functions.\\n\\n8\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \" 40s or 50s, but disease onset at a young age (in their 20s and 30s) is also possible [4]. EOAD is usually characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern; however, autosomal recessive inheritance may also be possible [5]. Three genes have been identified as causative factors for EOAD: amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, presenilin-1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14, and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1 [4]. These mutations are rare, as only 1% of patients carry APP mutations, 6% of patients carry PSEN1 mutations, and less than 1% of patients carry PSEN2 mutations [4]. Mutations in PSEN1 have been identified as the most common causative factor for EOAD, and patients with these mutations may present with a rapidly progressive disease [4,6]. To date, more than 300 mutations have been identified in PSEN1 [https://www.alzforum.org/mutations/psen-1, accessed on 1 July 2022]. In this review, we discuss the functions of PSEN1 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and its possible impact on other diseases. Additionally, we introduce PSEN1 mutations with their clinical phenotypes and the functional studies performed on these mutations. The PSEN1 protein contains 467 amino acids and shows 65% homology to the PSEN2 protein. PSEN1 is a transmembrane protein with nine transmembrane domains connected to hydrophilic loops in either the extracellular area or the cytosol. The N-terminal fragment and the large hydrophilic loop are located in the cytosol region, while the C-terminal fragment is located in the extracellular space. The large hydrophilic loop also contains a membrane-associated area. PSEN1 is a member of the \\u03b3-secretase complex that plays a key role in APP processing and amyloid peptide generation [7]. PSEN1 contains two catalytic aspartic acids (Asp275 and Asp 385, located on TM6 and TM7, respectively), that play key roles in both PSEN1 endoproteolytic activity and \\u03b3-secretase activity [8]. Additional critical residues were found in TM, located between positions 95 and 98. Mutations in these residues can inhibit or abolish PSEN1 proteolysis and \\u03b3-secretase activity [9]. An additional important residue could be Asp345, which is located in the loop between TM6 and TM7. A caspase cleavage site was located next to this amino acid, which plays a crucial role in the interaction between PSEN1 and its binding partners [8]. As part of the \\u03b3-secretase complex, PSEN1 or PSEN2 forms a complex with nicastrin (Nct), PSEN enhancer 2 (PEN2), and anterior pharynx 1 (APH-1). Furthermore, the \\u03b3-secretase complex is known to interact with various other proteins, including ubiquitin, protein-folding related proteins or adhesion molecules [10]. PSEN1 is involved in the C-terminal transmembrane region of APP and the production of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b242) by \\u03b3-secretase, after APP processing \\u03b1-and \\u03b2-secretases. PSEN1 may not be an enzyme itself, but a crucial regulator protein in \\u03b3-secretase cleavage. PSEN1 could also play a role in the transport of C-terminal APP fragment to the gamma secretase complex. A deficiency in PSEN1 function may impair APP processing, resulting\",\n",

Two residues in TM5, Met233 and Ile238 were revealed to be located near to Phe177 (in TM3). Residues in TM5 may form a hydrophilic environment around Phe177, and they may play a role in regulating the production of A\\u03b242 [124]. Mutations in Met233 were related to the accumulation of APP \\u03b2-C-terminal fragments, which may impair endosomal functions [128]. Furthermore, mutations in Met233 (especially Met233Val) may result in abnormal carboxypeptidase-like cleavage of \\u03b3-secretase, but they may not impact the endoproteolytic activity [166]. Phe237 may be involved in the formation of \\u03b3-secretase substrate binding pores by generating a hydrophobic pocket [60]. Besides the potential role in amyloid production, Leu235 may also have a critical role in pathogenic mechanisms. Mutations in this residue (particularly, Leu235Val) may impact the neurotransmitter metabolism. Leu235Val was found to accelerate the monoamine-oxidase-A (MAO-A) production, resulting in lower serotonin and noradrenalin expression, leading to depression [167]. Leu235Pro resulted in reduced levels of presynaptic synaptophysin in transgenic mice, suggesting that Leu235 may also impact the appropriate synaptic functions [168]. Mutations in Lys239 resulted in reduced expression of trophic factors involved in cell survival [94]. The frameshift mutation in Pro242 does not impact APP cleavage but may play a role in Notch signaling [169,170]. Furthermore, it may activate the production of several cytokines and chemokines in the case of lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore, it may activate the production of several cytokines and chemokines in the case of lipopolysaccharide stimulation [170] (Figure 8). TM5 mutations, for Met233Val [171,172], Ser237Cys [173], and Met233Ile [140] were also associated with juvenile disease cases (under 30). The diagnosis was initially FTD in some patients with Leu226Phe [174] or Met233Leu [175]. Behavioral or language impairment occurred in patients with different mutations, such as Gln223Arg [176], Ser230Asn [177], or Leu235Arg [178]. Motor impairments were also quite common among affected patients. The Azeri family with Met233Val initially developed ataxia; later, memory impairments appeared in affected individuals [172]. The affected patients from an American family developed motor skill delay in their childhood, encephalopathy in their 30s, and later they developed AD phenotypes [174]. Parkinsonism was observed in a Spanish family with Leu226Phe [91] and in a Chinese patient with Met233Val [179]. Corticobasal syndrome was also present in a Spanish family with Met233Leu [180], and Lewy bodies appeared in one family with Met233Val from the USA [181]. Interestingly, there was one mutation, Pro232fs (located on HL5), which was not associated with AD or any other neurodegenerative phenotypes. This frameshift mutation resulted in familial acne inversa in Chinese families. The patients displayed hair follicle inflammation and several skin abnormalities, such as abscess in the skin, sinus drains, or scars [169,170].

Mutations in presenilin (PS) lead to abnormal generation of A\\u03b2, which is the major cause of familial AD (FAD), and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD (SAD) onset. However, whether dysfunction of PS is involved in the pathogenesis of SAD is largely unknown. We found that ApoE secretion was completely abolished in PS-deficient cells and markedly decreased by inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity. Blockade of \\u03b3-secretase activity by a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, decreased ApoE secretion, suggesting an important role of \\u03b3-secretase activity in ApoE secretion. Reduced ApoE secretion is also observed in nicastrin-deficient cells with reduced \\u03b3-secretase activity. PS deficiency enhanced nuclear translocation of ApoE and binding of ApoE to importin \\u03b14, a nuclear transport receptor. Moreover, the expression of PS mutants in PS-deficient cells suppressed the restoration effects on ApoE secretion compared with the expression of wild-type PS. Plasma ApoE levels were lower in FAD patients carrying PS1 mutations compared with normal control subjects. Our findings suggest a novel role of PS contributing to the pathogenesis of SAD by regulating ApoE secretion. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Familial AD (FAD) typically results from mutations in the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PS1), or PS2. Many PS mutants have been found to exert impaired \\u03b3-secretase activity and increased amyloid-\\u03b2 42 (A\\u03b242)/A\\u03b240 ratio, which induce early amyloid deposition and FAD. On the other hand, apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD (SAD) and contributes to AD pathogenesis because it has reduced A\\u03b2 clearance capability compared with ApoE3 and ApoE2. FAD and SAD have long been considered to be caused by these two independent mechanisms; however, for the first time, we demonstrated that PS is essential for ApoE secretion and PS mutants affected ApoE secretion in vitro and in human samples, suggesting a novel mechanism by which PS is also involved in SAD pathogenesis.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

The existence of two homologous PSENs (PSEN1 and PSEN2) and several APH1 isoforms generates separate complexes that have distinct subcellular distributions, providing a basis for substrate selectivity (H\\u00e9bert et al., 2004; Sannerud et al., 2016; Shirotani et al., 2004). Mutations in the PSEN and APP genes cause early-onset familial AD (FAD) and increase total A\\u03b2 or the production of longer, more toxic A\\u03b2 peptides (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Szaruga et al., 2017). All four \\u03b3-secretase components are transmembrane proteins that are cotranslationally inserted in the ER; however, how assembly is regulated is still poorly understood. The early biosynthetic pathway consists of three compartments: the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and the Golgi apparatus. All three are critically involved in the proper assembly of multimeric protein complexes as part of secondary quality control mechanisms (Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003; Michelsen et al., 2005). Thus far, full \\u03b3-secretase assembly has been reported to take place in or during transport between pre-Golgi compartments (Capell et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2004), but the exact sequence of events and the essential compartments remain elusive. Moreover, none of the \\u03b3-secretase subunits bear confirmed ER exit or retrieval motifs, arguing that additional mechanisms are at stake in directing assembly. For instance, retrieval of individual subunits, including NCT and PEN-2, is regulated through interaction with the Golgi-to-ER cargo retrieval receptor RER1p at the ERGIC/cis-Golgi (Kaether et al., 2007; Park et al., 2012; Spasic et al., 2007). This interaction negatively controls assembly, underscoring that affecting complex assembly in biosynthetic compartments impacts cellular \\u03b3-secretase activity. Other potential regulatory components of \\u03b3-secretase were identified, such as CD147 and TMP21, but their direct link to assembly has not been elucidated (Chen et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2005). ER exit is governed through cargo sorting into coat protein complex II (COPII)\\u2013coated vesicles (Lee et al., 2004). Herein, the small GTPase Sar1p is recruited to its ER-localized GTP exchange factor, Sec12p (Barlowe and Schekman, 1993; Sato et al., 1996). This initiates the sequential recruitment of COPII coat proteins, first the Sec23/24p complex and next the Sec13/31p complex, deforming the ER membrane along with packaging cargo into nascent vesicles (Barlowe et al., 1994; McCaughey and Stephens, 2019). Sec24p has four paralogs, and the presence of multiple cargo binding sites makes it an important player in capturing a broad range of cargo molecules exiting the ER (Mancias and Goldberg, 2008; Zanetti et al., 2012). Thus far, PSEN1 has been shown to largely depend on Sec24A for ER exit (Kim et al., 2007), and its packaging into COPII vesicles appeared to be uncoupled from APP (Kim et al., 2005), suggesting distinct carriers for export of enzyme and substrate. To our knowledge, no other transport motifs or mechanisms used by individual \\u03b3-secretase components to mediate ER-Golgi transport have been identified.

Besides A\\u03b240, other short amyloids, such as A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b237, may also be reduced in the case of PSEN1 mutations (e.g., PSEN1 Ala97Val or Val89Leu). Reduced levels of short amyloids may also be a marker of lower amyloid trimming activity and reduced \\u03b3-secretase processivity. Furthermore, the reduced ratio of combined short amyloids vs. combined long amyloids ((A\\u03b238 + A\\u03b237 + A\\u03b240)/(A\\u03b242 + A\\u03b243)) may be a useful marker of disease pathogenicity [73,281]. PSEN1 has been identified as the most common causative gene for early onset AD. To date, more than 300 mutations have been reported in PSEN1 that potentially play a role in neurodegenerative pathways. Most PSEN1 mutations are heterozygous and follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. However, homozygous forms of PSEN1 mutations, such as Ala431Glu or Glu280Ala, have also been observed. The homozygous forms of PSEN1 mutations may be associated with a more aggressive disease phenotype than the heterozygous mutations [262]. A compound heterozygous case of PSEN1 was also discovered, wherein the patient carried a STOP codon mutation at residue Ser357 and the Arg377Trp mutation. However, it remains unclear whether these two mutations affect disease onset [225]. PSEN1 mutations could result in neurodegeneration through both gain-of-function [282] or loss-of-function mechanisms [283]. Hardy and Higgins (1992) proposed the amyloid hypothesis, suggesting that the accumulated amyloid peptides may be the main causative factors for AD related neurodegeneration. Additionally, mutant PSEN1 mutations (such as Met84Val, Leu85Pro, His163Arg, His163Pro, Met233Leu) could enhance the APP processing and amyloid peptide (A\\u03b242) generation. However, this study also raised concerns about the amyloid hypothesis. For example, amyloid plaques in the brain may not correlate with the degree of neurodegeneration. Additionally, amyloid production in cell cultures may not correlate with the age of onset or disease phenotypes [40,282,284,285,286]. Later, the amyloid hypothesis was refuted further. It was revealed that elevated A\\u03b242 may not be the only factor leading to PSEN1-related neurodegeneration. For example, PSEN1 mutations may result in earlier disease onset, compared to mutations in APP, even though A\\u03b242/40 ratio may not be as significant as expected [286]. Additionally, amyloid overproduction did not result in significant neurodegeneration in mouse models [285,286,287]. These findings suggest that the loss of PSEN1 functions may play a crucial role in AD progression. PSEN knockout mice presented a significant degree of neurodegeneration; however, the level of both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 was reduced. PSEN knockout could result in an elevated degree of neuroinflammation, reduced neuroprotection and an increased degree of apoptosis [288,289,290]. Shen and Kelleher (2007) proposed the presenilin hypothesis of AD, which may provide an alternative view of disease pathogenesis. The loss of essential PSEN1 (and PSEN2) functions may result in AD-related neurodegeneration. Several PSEN1 mutations (Gly209Arg, Gly209Val, Leu235Pro, Cys410T\",\n",

This disease is related to several cellular alterations like the loss of synapses, neuronal death, disruption of lipid homeostasis, mitochondrial fragmentation, or raised oxidative stress. Notably, changes in the autophagic pathway have turned out to be a key factor in the early development of the disease. The aim of this research is to determine the impact of the APOE allele \\u03b54 and G206D-PSEN1 on the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Fibroblasts from Alzheimer\\u2019s patients with APOE 3/4 + G206D-PSEN1 mutation and homozygous APOE \\u03b54 were used to study the effects of APOE polymorphism and PSEN1 mutation on the autophagy pathway, mitochondrial network fragmentation, superoxide anion levels, lysosome clustering, and p62/SQSTM1 levels. We observed that the APOE allele \\u03b54 in homozygosis induces mitochondrial network fragmentation that correlates with an increased colocalization with p62/SQSTM1, probably due to an inefficient autophagy. Moreover, G206D-PSEN1 mutation causes an impairment of the integrity of mitochondrial networks, triggering high superoxide anion levels and thus making APOE 3/4 + PSEN1 fibroblasts more vulnerable to cell death induced by oxidative stress. Of note, PSEN1 mutation induces accumulation and clustering of lysosomes that, along with an increase of global p62/SQSTM1, could compromise lysosomal function and, ultimately, its degradation. The findings suggest that all these modifications could eventually contribute to the neuronal degeneration that underlies the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Further research in this area may help to develop targeted therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by impaired behavior, cognitive dysfunction, and episodic memory loss; being the most common dementia in the elderly and the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease (Masters et al., 2015). From the genetic standpoint, AD can be divided into two different categories: the familiar form (<10% of all cases) and the sporadic form (90\\u201395% of cases). The familial form (FAD) has an early onset. It is triggered by mutations in any of the three primary genes linked to AD: APP (amyloid precursor protein) gene, PSEN1 (presenilin) or PSEN2 (presenilin) gene (Dorszewska et al., 2016) in chromosomes 21 and 14, respectively. These genes contribute to the amyloidogenic pathway by which the APP protein is consecutively cleaved and processed to produce A\\u03b2 oligomers susceptible to aggregate (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002).

(2006) co-introduced eight PSEN1 mutations with Swedish APP mutations (Lys670Asn and Met671Leu) into HEK293 cell lines using plasmid methods. This study revealed a strong correlation between age at disease onset and an elevated A\\u03b242/40 ratio, higher A\\u03b242, and lower A\\u03b240 levels [48]. Sun et al.

This study did not find a correlation between the A\\u03b242/40 ratio and the age at disease onset. The majority of mutant cells showed reduced levels of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, and approximately 10% of the mutations were related to the A\\u03b242/40 ratio. This study suggests that the amyloid hypothesis may not be the only hypothesis in the case of AD onset, and other risk factors should be examined [94]. Hsu et al. used N2a cell lines to verify several VUS in EOAD-causing genes, including PSEN1. This study identified 19 mutations (11 PSEN1 mutations) as probable pathogenic variants [39]. Li et al. (2016) analyzed several PSEN1 mutations in HEK293 cell lines, revealing that in addition to the A\\u03b242/40 ratio, the cleavage of A\\u03b243 to A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b240 may be reduced in the case of PSEN1 mutations. Some PSEN1 mutations could affect the A\\u03b242/40 ratio through the A\\u03b249/A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b248/38 ratios, whereas some mutations could only affect one of them [166]. The majority of PSEN1 mutations result in an elevated A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio by elevating A\\u03b242 production or reducing A\\u03b240 production. Increased levels of A\\u03b242 and/or reduced levels of short A\\u03b240 in cell and animal models may provide strong proof of the pathogenic nature of the mutation [273]. In addition to A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, other products may reflect the altered \\u03b3-secretase process. APP processing may be initiated by \\u03b2-secretase cleavage, which results in the release of the N-terminal region of the protein. The membrane-bound remnant of APP, called C99, is processed by \\u03b3-secretase. This process could result in long amyloid peptides with endopeptidase activity (43\\u201351 bp), which could be cleaved to A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 through carboxypeptidase activity [279]. Few mutations may reduce the endo- or carboxypeptidase activity of \\u03b3-secretase, resulting in the generation of long amyloid peptides, including A\\u03b243, A\\u03b246, or A\\u03b248 [280].

Heterozygous mutations in the PSEN1 gene cause early-onset familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (eFAD) and increase the proportion of longer aggregation-prone amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243).

Using dual recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (dRMCE), here we generated a panel of isogenic embryonic and neural stem cell lines with heterozygous, endogenous expression of PSEN1 mutations. When catalytically inactive PSEN1 was expressed alongside the wild-type protein, we found the mutant accumulated as a full-length protein, indicating that endoproteolytic cleavage occurred strictly as an intramolecular event. Heterozygous expression of eFAD-causing PSEN1 mutants increased the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio. In contrast, catalytically inactive PSEN1 mutants were still incorporated into the \\u03b3-secretase complex but failed to change the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio. Finally, interaction and enzyme activity assays demonstrated the binding of mutant PSEN1 to other \\u03b3-secretase subunits, but no interaction between mutant and wild-type PSEN1 was observed. These results establish that pathogenic A\\u03b2 production is an intrinsic property of PSEN1 mutants and strongly argue against a dominant-negative effect in which PSEN1 mutants would compromise the catalytic activity of wild-type PSEN1 through conformational effects.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nThe aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides in the brain is believed to be the initial trigger in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), the most common cause of clinical dementia (1).

The remaining membrane-bound APP C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF, C99) is a substrate for the intramembrane aspartyl protease \\u03b3-secretase, which has both endo- and carboxypeptidase activities (2, 3). Endoproteolysis (\\u03b5-cleavage) occurs at two adjacent cleavage sites close to the cytosolic end of the C99 transmembrane domain (TMD), resulting in long A\\u03b2 peptides of 49 or 48 amino acids (A\\u03b249, A\\u03b248) that remain attached to the membrane, and\",\n",

However, for some PSEN1 mutations, subtle changes in the use of the initial endoproteolytic cleavage site might induce more frequent processing of the APP substrate in the A\\u03b242 generating product line contributing to an increase in the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio, which is supported by mutagenesis studies indicating changes in the molecular interaction of PSEN1 mutants with the APP substrate (25, 41, 42). The reduced carboxypeptidase processivity of PSEN1 mutants resulting in a larger proportion of aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 peptides has been regarded as a gain-of-function mechanism. Alternatively, the occurrence of PSEN1 missense mutations throughout the coding region without apparent mutational hot spots could be indicative of a loss-of-function mechanism. Furthermore, to explain the autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern associated with heterozygous PSEN1 missense mutations, it has been proposed that PSEN1 mutants are dominant-negative and function as antimorphs in trans by interacting with and obstructing the function of the wild-type protein expressed from the second PSEN1 allele (43, 44, 45, 46). Support for this so-called presenilin hypothesis was drawn from several experimental observations including the age-dependent neurodegeneration and memory impairments in conditional PSEN1/PSEN2 double knockout mice (47, 48), the drastically reduced enzyme activity of some PSEN1 mutants when assessed in overexpression or homozygous knock-in models (32, 40, 49, 50, 51), and the large size of \\u03b3-secretase complexes observed in early purification attempts consistent with oligomerization of its subunits (52, 53, 54). By transient co-transfection into PSEN-deficient cells, evidence was provided that mutant PSEN1 could perturb the enzymatic activity and A\\u03b242 generation of wild-type PSEN1 through direct physical interaction, and it was proposed that mutant PSEN1 might allosterically alter the conformation of wild-type PSEN1 (55). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that co-incubation of purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes containing wild-type PSEN1 with complexes containing mutant PSEN1 reduced A\\u03b2 generation, supporting a dominant-negative effect on enzyme activity through hetero-oligomerization. Moreover, in the presence of different detergents, the proteolytic activity of purified \\u03b3-secretase was correlated with its oligomerization (56). In addition, using super-resolution microscopy, a recent study reported that a substantial fraction of \\u03b3-secretase in the plasma membrane appeared to be dimeric (57). However, other biochemical and structural studies have provided definitive evidence that the four subunits of the \\u03b3-secretase complex are present in a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry and could not demonstrate an interaction between wild-type and mutant PSEN1 by co-immunoprecipitation (12, 17, 58). These controversial results might in part be related to the predominant use of experimental models that did not accurately resemble the heterozygous genetic background in patients with eFAD in which the mutant PSEN1 allele is expressed in the context of one wild-type PSEN1 and two wild-type PSEN2 alleles. In this study, using genome engineering, we have generated a panel of isogenic murine embryonic stem (ES) cell lines and derived neural stem cells (NSCs) with a heterozygous expression of eFAD P\",\n",

Several PSEN1 mutations (Gly209Arg, Gly209Val, Leu235Pro, Cys410Tyr, Leu435Phe) may not significantly impact the A\\u03b242 levels (or even reduce it), but they may reduce (or abrogate) the A\\u03b240 production significantly. Pathogenic PSEN1 mutations may impair the \\u03b3-secretase functions through dominant-negative mechanisms. Elevated amyloid levels may also inhibit further the \\u03b3-secretase functions. Loss of PSEN activity may result in abnormalities in synaptic functions, leading to neuronal loss, Tau hyperphosphorylation and dementia. Further studies are also needed on the PSEN hypothesis. For example, APP mutations may not inhibit \\u03b3-secretase related pathways. Additionally, not all PSEN1 mutations could result in a Tau-related pathology [40,283,291]. Besides amyloid and PSEN hypothesis, other AD-hypotheses were also described, such as the Tau hypothesis, the inflammation hypothesis, and the cholinergic and oxidative stress hypothesis, confirming that AD is a very complex disease. There is no absolute hypothesis available on AD progression, but all possible hypotheses could provide an explanation for AD progression and help drug development [282,291,292]. As mentioned before, PSEN1 mutations may impair \\u03b3-secretase mechanisms, resulting in impaired amyloid production and elevated long amyloid/short amyloid (typically A\\u03b242/40) ratio [6]. Furthermore, PSEN1 could affect other mechanisms, such as calcium homeostasis or Notch signaling [6]. Compared to APP- and PSEN2-related cases, EOAD patients with PSEN1 mutations may have an earlier disease onset [293]. Additionally, in the case of APP mutations, memory decline is the initial symptom, whereas PSEN1 mutations may lead to atypical phenotypes, such as seizures or motor-behavioral or language dysfunctions. The mutation location may impact the PSEN1 phenotype. With regard to the atypical symptoms in cases of PSEN1 mutations, the location of the mutation may be important. Mutations located in the N-terminal region (before codon 200) may more frequently represent myoclonus, seizures, visuospatial symptoms, or spasticity. Meanwhile, among patients who carry mutations in the C-terminal area (after codon 200), cotton wool plaques and amyloid antipathy may be relatively common [292]. Brain imaging has revealed that APP mutations may result in a higher degree of hippocampal atrophy. PSEN1 mutations may also affect other brain areas such as the neocortex or white matter [77]. The phenotypic diversity of PSEN1 mutations may also be related to its involvement in \\u03b3-secretase function. PSEN1 impacts the formation of the \\u03b3-secretase catalytic subunit, and in addition to APP processing, it could impact multiple substrate cleavage (\\u03b2-catenin, Notch). PSEN1 mutations can affect endopeptidase and carboxylpeptidase activities, which may result in different types of neurodegenerative process [284,294]. Interestingly, patients with the same PSEN1 mutations may have different ages of onset or clinical course. For example, EOAD with PSEN1 Thr119Ile has been discovered in multiple patients with a wide age range of ages of disease onset (between 49 and 71 years); some cases developed memory decline only, while in others, personality changes and psychological symptoms were present. It is possible that other genetic factors may impact disease onset and clinical course, for example, variants in\",\n",

       "</span><span class=\"diff-line\"> Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Luo &amp; Li, 2022). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Luo &amp; Li, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Checler et al., 2021).\n",

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Luo & Li, 2022). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Luo & Li, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Svedružić et al., 2023). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Bagaria et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Luo & Li, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Svedružić et al., 2023). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Bagaria et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Luo & Li, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Luo & Li, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma-secretase have faced challenges, as seen with the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat and avagacestat due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in patients (Luo & Li, 2022). However, ongoing research into the role of gamma-secretase in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction continues to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. The use of biomarkers, such as CSF Aβ levels, has also been investigated for their utility in assessing drug-target engagement in clinical settings (Svedružić et al., 2023). Additionally, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity through selective inhibitors or modulators may provide a pathway for therapeutic intervention while minimizing side effects (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "Effective treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease may require a nuanced approach to modulating gamma-secretase activity. This includes the development of substrate-specific inhibitors that can reduce toxic Aβ production while preserving essential functions of the gamma-secretase complex (Luo & Li, 2022). Additionally, exploring gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to correct presenilin mutations offers a promising avenue for future therapies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression (Svedružić et al., 2023). The integration of findings linking Aβ42 levels and gamma-secretase inhibition into therapeutic strategies could provide new insights into managing AD effectively (Bagaria et al., 2022).\n",

Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a), but kinetic modeling combined with informative site-directed mutagenesis will be important to fully unravel the function of these remarkable structures (Bhattarai et al, 2022; Chen et al, 2023; Petit et al, 2022b).

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) is triggering the disease. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavages of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. The latter cleavage by \\u03b3-secretase, a unique and fascinating four-component protease complex, occurs in the APP transmembrane domain thereby releasing A\\u03b2 species of 37-43 amino acids in length including the longer, highly pathogenic peptides A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243. The lack of a precise understanding of A\\u03b2 generation as well as of the functions of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key AD drug target in the past few years. Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the \\u03b3-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes \\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP into different A\\u03b2 species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of A\\u03b242/43. Finally, we discuss how the knowledge emerging from these studies could be used to therapeutically target this enzyme in a safe way.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u00b4s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide currently affecting about 47 millions people. The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3.

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

However, antibody therapy may not be the optimal therapeutic modality for AD prevention, as we will discuss in the context of the earlier small molecules described as \\u201c\\u03b3-secretase modulators\\u201d (GSM). We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced. We propose the term \\u201c\\u03b3-secretase allosteric stabilizers\\u201d (GSAS) to distinguish these compounds from the rather heterogenous class of GSM. The GSAS represent, in theory, a precision medicine approach to the prevention of amyloid deposition, as they specifically target a discrete aspect in a complex cell biological signalling mechanism that initiates the pathological processes leading to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023).

It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma-secretase have faced challenges, as seen with the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat and avagacestat due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). However, ongoing research into the role of gamma-secretase in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction continues to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. The use of biomarkers, such as CSF Aβ levels, has also been investigated for their utility in assessing drug-target engagement in clinical settings (Steiner et al., 2018). Additionally, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity through selective inhibitors or modulators may provide a pathway for therapeutic intervention while minimizing side effects (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "Effective treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease may require a nuanced approach to modulating gamma-secretase activity. This includes the development of substrate-specific inhibitors that can reduce toxic Aβ production while preserving essential functions of the gamma-secretase complex (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Additionally, exploring gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to correct presenilin mutations offers a promising avenue for future therapies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression (Steiner et al., 2018). The integration of findings linking Aβ42 levels and gamma-secretase inhibition into therapeutic strategies could provide new insights into managing AD effectively (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

The molecular properties of substrates, which are recognized by \\u03b3-secretase differentiating them from nonsubstrates, are largely unknown. Since cleavages of C99 and Notch1 are kinetically extremely slow with very low turnover numbers kcat\\n76110, it is likely that conformational flexibility of the substrate, in particular TMD helix dynamics, plays an important role to find the conformations that allow productive accommodation into the enzyme at the exosites and/or the active site 111112.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch.

Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest.

Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions.

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

The analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activity in human brain samples of PS1 FAD cases has shown that AICD formation is not affected whereas the carboxy-terminal processivity defects leading to increase A\\u03b242/40 ratios persist 117. These data strongly suggest that potential effects on the \\\"signaling cleavage\\\" are compensated by the remaining wt PS alleles. A recent study investigating a total of 138 PS1 FAD mutations could not find a correlation with increased A\\u03b242 ratios and the age of onset while the vast majority of the mutants showed strongly reduced total \\u03b3-secretase activity 135. This has been taken as another argument in favor of the presenilin hypothesis. However, the A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 levels and corresponding A\\u03b242/40 ratios of many PS1 FAD mutants that are well-characterized in cell-based assays were not recapitulated well in these assays and the pathogenic A\\u03b243 species had not been measured in the study. Moreover, predicting the age of onset of mutations from \\u03b3-secretase activities measured in cell-free in vitro assays using purified \\u03b3-secretase preparations in which loss of function effects are known to be more strongly pronounced 136 is problematic as this system differs dramatically from the heterozygous situation in FAD patient brain. Importantly, if loss of \\u03b3-secretase activity by presenilin mutations should be causative for AD, then haploinsufficiency of other \\u03b3-secretase subunits should also cause the disease. However, nonsense mutations that have been identified in PS1, NCT and PEN-2 are implicated in the cause of the rare skin disease acne inversa and not AD 137. Finally, it is obvious that all types of APP FAD mutations as well as the protective Icelandic mutation or the presence of AD in Down syndrome patients with an APP gene triplication are not explainable by the presenilin hypothesis. Taken together, balancing the available evidence, the support of the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains overwhelming, whereas the problems of the presenilin hypothesis persist. Since the amyloid cascade hypothesis predicts that lowering A\\u03b2 should be beneficial for AD, \\u03b3-secretase has been an obvious and major drug target. Thus, to inhibit its enzymatic activity and blocking A\\u03b2 generation, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were developed 138139. They fall into two principal classes, transition-state analogue (TSA) inhibitors, such as the prototypic L-685,458 140 and related compounds as well as non-TSA compounds. The former compounds, which target the catalytic site of \\u03b3-secretase were the first highly potent inhibitors identified. Non-TSA inhibitors such as DAPT 141 or LY450139 (semagacestat) 142 are considered to bind nearby the active site. Unfortunately, since such pan-GSIs inhibit both A\\u03b2 and Notch ICD (NICD) production, severe side effects were observed when administered in vivo, mainly due to disturbance of Notch signaling 143144145146. While this is unwanted for AD therapy, treatment of certain cancers may benefit from Notch pathway inhibition by GSIs 147. Several non-TSA GSIs were reported to have less inhibitory effects on NICD generation at a concentration range at which they sufficiently reduce A\\u03b2 secretion. Such Notch-sparing GSIs, as for example the promising candidate BMS-708163 (avagacestat) 148, were thus considered as improved\",\n",

Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain.

The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3. A\\u03b2 is a small hydrophobic ~4 kDa peptide, which is derived by sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a single pass transmembrane protein with type I topology which is expressed in neurons\",\n",

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy.

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50). Further studies also revealed a very complex cleavage of APP-CTFs by \\u03b3-secretase, since it takes place within the membrane and successively at several sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6-, \\u03b3- and \\u03b3\\u2032). The first endopeptidase cleavage (\\u025b-cleavage) can occur at two distinct sites leading to the generation of A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249, which is then shortened by sequential carboxypeptidase cleavages (trimming) at \\u03b6, \\u03b3-and \\u03b3\\u2032-sites, occurring at each three or four residues and via two distinct product lines (A\\u03b249 > A\\u03b246 > A\\u03b243 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b237) or (A\\u03b248 > A\\u03b245 > A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b238) and the final occurrence of peptides of varying lengths but two major species of 40 or 42 amino acid residues, respectively (51). Whereas A\\u03b240 is the most abundant peptide, A\\u03b242 is considered as the most pathogenic due to its high aggregation propensity.Figure\\u00a02\\u03b3-secretase.A, displays a schematic representation of presenilins (PS1 or PS2) composed of nine transmembrane domains and harboring the catalytic core of the complex with two aspartyl residues in the transmembrane domains TM-6 and TM-7.

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01).

Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242. The compound BMS-932,481 (Soares et al, 2016) had the desired effects on A\\u03b2: decreased A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, and increased A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 without effecting total A\\u03b2 in humans. However, liver toxicity limited the dose, and further clinical development has stopped. From the published work, compound PF-06648671 (Ahn et al, 2020) appears promising. Three phase-I clinical trials involving in total of 120 patients exposed to single and multiple-ascending doses have been reported (Ahn et al, 2020).

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

Due to the decreased Notch signaling and the accumulation of APP-CTFs122, side effects such as the risk of skin cancer and infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and worsening cognition led to the pause of clinical trials5,124,125. Therefore, these GSIs are nonselective and inhibit both APP and Notch121,124,126. Avagacestat was reported as a \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI and was shown to have a higher selectivity for APP over Notch cleavage127. However, avagacestat was suggested to be nonselective later based on poor Notch-sparing activity122,128 and its binding site as PS1-NTF128. Another \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI, begacestat (GSI-953, Wyeth/Pfizer), was also discontinued in phase I clinical trial, and the reasons are unclear129. Another concern regarding GSI treatment is the A\\u03b2 rebound effect. GSIs at lower doses increased A\\u03b2 levels, and discontinuation of GSI treatment was observed with a rebound of A\\u03b2 levels130,131. These GSIs target PS1-NTF128.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions.

Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3].

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

For the first time, both Tau and pTau181 can be measured in plasma to predict brain Tau load and neurodegeneration, for monitoring the efficacy of \\u03b2- or \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors/modulators in clinical trials. Existing \\u03b2-/\\u03b3-secretase inhibitors/modulators can then be tested in sub-cohorts selected by AT(N) biomarker. One plausible explanation for negative clinical results is that BACE1 inhibitors and GSIs/GSMs were given too late, during the irreversible phase of the disease (MCI/prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD), and patients need to be treated at earlier stage of AD to prevent neurodegeneration. The phase III trial of BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat by Merck in patients with prodromal AD (MCI) was discontinued in 2018, similar to the phase II/III trial of atabecestat by Janssen. In addition, side effects and toxicity account for a number of failed trials, such as the inhibition of Notch signaling by GSIs. Recent studies on BACE1 knockout mice suggested that BACE1 inhibitors may disrupt the axonal organization in the hippocampus, and impair synaptic plasticity, leading to defects in learning and memory (Ou-Yang et al., 2018; Lombardo et al., 2019). Inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase cleavage can lead to the accumulation of C99 fragment (Lauritzen et al., 2019a), which was correlated to the acceleration of early neurodegenerative process in AD (Lauritzen et al., 2012; Lauritzen et al., 2019b). An obstacle for the development of selective GSMs is the lack of information about the structural characteristics of \\u03b3-secretase-substrate complex. Recent cryo-EM structure of \\u03b3-secretase bound to the C83 fragment and Notch substrate (Yang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019) started to fill this crucial knowledge gap. An \\u03b1-helical to \\u03b2-strand transition was observed at the C-terminal of APPTM, forming an anti-parallel, intermolecular \\u03b2-sheet with two induced \\u03b2-strands from presenilin (Figure 8). The unwinding of C-terminal transmembrane helix exposes the initial \\u03b5-cleavage sites (T48, L49) to interact with \\u03b3-secretase (Zhou et al., 2019). These are in agreement with earlier Raman and NMR spectroscopic studies carried out on APPTM and PSHs in solution, which showed that substrate binding is coupled with helical unwinding to prime the substrate for peptide bond hydrolysis (Brown et al., 2018; Clemente et al., 2018). The unwinding model of \\u03b3-secretase-APP interaction. This unwinding model of the substrate in \\u03b3-secretase-APP interaction suggests that targeting APP, especially the C-terminal of APPTM, could be a new strategy in selective amyloid reduction. A substrate-specific inhibitor is not expected to affect the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage of other physiological substrates, the assembly of the \\u03b3-secretase complex, or any presenilin function (Saura et al., 2004; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2012; Barthet et al., 2013), thereby sparing the side effects associated with broad-spectrum \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors. A novel compound C1 was found to interact with the C-terminal juxtamembrane lysines of APP and inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase production of A\\u03b2 both in vitro and in cell (Zhao et al., 2020). This study provides the first in vitro evidence that targeting the C-terminal juxtamembrane lysines is sufficient for reducing\",\n",

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a), but kinetic modeling combined with informative site-directed mutagenesis will be important to fully unravel the function of these remarkable structures (Bhattarai et al, 2022; Chen et al, 2023; Petit et al, 2022b).

      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that is essential for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma-secretase have faced challenges, as seen with the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat and avagacestat due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). However, ongoing research into the role of gamma-secretase in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction continues to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. The use of biomarkers, such as CSF Aβ levels, has also been investigated for their utility in assessing drug-target engagement in clinical settings (Steiner et al., 2018). Additionally, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity through selective inhibitors or modulators may provide a pathway for therapeutic intervention while minimizing side effects (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "Effective treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease may require a nuanced approach to modulating gamma-secretase activity. This includes the development of substrate-specific inhibitors that can reduce toxic Aβ production while preserving essential functions of the gamma-secretase complex (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Additionally, exploring gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to correct presenilin mutations offers a promising avenue for future therapies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression (Steiner et al., 2018). The integration of findings linking Aβ42 levels and gamma-secretase inhibition into therapeutic strategies could provide new insights into managing AD effectively (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions.

Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the \\u03b3-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes \\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP into different A\\u03b2 species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of A\\u03b242/43. Finally, we discuss how the knowledge emerging from these studies could be used to therapeutically target this enzyme in a safe way.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u00b4s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide currently affecting about 47 millions people. The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3. A\\u03b2 is a small hydrophobic ~4 kDa peptide, which is derived by sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a single pass transmembrane protein with type I topology which is expressed in neurons\",\n",

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter.

Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded.

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50).

      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",

Furthermore, \\\"pan-GSIs\\\" inhibit both A\\u03b2 and Notch ICD production, leading to severe side effects. While non-TSA inhibitors like BMS-708163 exhibit reduced Notch pathway inhibition, indicating potential for selective inhibition, the implications of \\u03b3-secretase dysfunction on AD remain complex and under debate.\\n\\n8\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \" pathways mediated by their ICDs, this seems unlikely to play a major role in vivo. The analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activity in human brain samples of PS1 FAD cases has shown that AICD formation is not affected whereas the carboxy-terminal processivity defects leading to increase A\\u03b242/40 ratios persist 117. These data strongly suggest that potential effects on the \\\"signaling cleavage\\\" are compensated by the remaining wt PS alleles. A recent study investigating a total of 138 PS1 FAD mutations could not find a correlation with increased A\\u03b242 ratios and the age of onset while the vast majority of the mutants showed strongly reduced total \\u03b3-secretase activity 135. This has been taken as another argument in favor of the presenilin hypothesis. However, the A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 levels and corresponding A\\u03b242/40 ratios of many PS1 FAD mutants that are well-characterized in cell-based assays were not recapitulated well in these assays and the pathogenic A\\u03b243 species had not been measured in the study. Moreover, predicting the age of onset of mutations from \\u03b3-secretase activities measured in cell-free in vitro assays using purified \\u03b3-secretase preparations in which loss of function effects are known to be more strongly pronounced 136 is problematic as this system differs dramatically from the heterozygous situation in FAD patient brain. Importantly, if loss of \\u03b3-secretase activity by presenilin mutations should be causative for AD, then haploinsufficiency of other \\u03b3-secretase subunits should also cause the disease. However, nonsense mutations that have been identified in PS1, NCT and PEN-2 are implicated in the cause of the rare skin disease acne inversa and not AD 137. Finally, it is obvious that all types of APP FAD mutations as well as the protective Icelandic mutation or the presence of AD in Down syndrome patients with an APP gene triplication are not explainable by the presenilin hypothesis. Taken together, balancing the available evidence, the support of the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains overwhelming, whereas the problems of the presenilin hypothesis persist. Since the amyloid cascade hypothesis predicts that lowering A\\u03b2 should be beneficial for AD, \\u03b3-secretase has been an obvious and major drug target. Thus, to inhibit its enzymatic activity and blocking A\\u03b2 generation, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were developed 138139. They fall into two principal classes, transition-state analogue (TSA) inhibitors, such as the prototypic L-685,458 140 and related compounds as well as non-TSA compounds. The former compounds, which target the catalytic site of \\u03b3-secretase were the first highly potent inhibitors identified. Non-TSA inhibitors such as DAPT 141 or LY450139 (semagacestat) 142 are considered to bind nearby the active site. Unfortunately, since such pan-GSIs inhibit both A\\u03b2 and Notch ICD (NICD) production, severe side effects were observed when administered in vivo, mainly due to disturbance of Notch signaling 143144145146. While this is unwanted for AD therapy, treatment of certain cancers may benefit from Notch pathway inhibition by GSIs 147. Several non-TSA GSIs were reported to have less inhibitory effects on NICD generation at a concentration range at which they sufficiently reduce A\\u03b2 secretion. Such Notch-sparing GSIs, as for example the promising candidate BMS-708163 (avagacestat) 148, were thus considered as improved\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced.

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4.

We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms.

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with GPR3 KO mice also decreased A\\u03b2 production, and GPR3 was expressed in the brains of SAD patients92. GPCRs require adaptor proteins such as arrestins to prevent further G protein-mediated signaling206. \\u03b2-Arrestin1 is highly expressed in the brain206, and \\u03b2-arrestin1 KO mice exhibit reduced A\\u03b2 production and spared Notch cleavage207. \\u03b2-arrestin1 interacts only with Aph-1 in \\u03b3-secretase, and overexpression of \\u03b2-arrestin1 enhanced mature \\u03b3-secretase complex formation at 440\\u2009kDa207. KO of \\u03b2-arrestin1 in APP/PS1 mice decreased A\\u03b2 production and improved memory deficits207. Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) was also reported to regulate the assembly of \\u03b3-secretase complexes and contribute to A\\u03b2 pathogenesis208. SERP1 interacts with the Aph-1a/Nct subcomplex of \\u03b3-secretase and increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 generation but reduces Notch processing208.

Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211. Hur et al.158 showed that IFITM3 binds to PS1-NTF in active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production (A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242) (Fig. 6).

Recent cryo-EM structures show that semagacestat and avagacestat bind close to the critical mixed \\u03b2-sheath that stabilizes APP and Notch in the catalytic cleft of \\u03b3-secretase (Fig.\\u00a03) (Zhou et al, 2019; Yang et al, 2019). While it seems unlikely that GSIs will be reconsidered in the future for the treatment of AD because of these side effects, (selective) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition might be useful in other therapeutic areas (Jurisch-Yaksi et al, 2013), for instance, various cancers (Habets et al, 2019; Ranganathan et al, 2011) and hearing loss (Tona et al, 2014) among others, especially when Notch signaling is involved (Christopoulos et al, 2021; McCaw et al, 2021). Actually, nirogacestat (Ogsiveo) is the first GSI that reached regulatory approval for rare desmoid tumors (Gounder et al, 2023). While developing such Notch inhibitors, it is important to take into account that at least four different \\u03b3-secretase complexes exist (see main text: The discovery of \\u03b3-secretases) resulting from the four possible combinations of the constituting subunits PSEN1 or 2, APH1A or B, NCT, and PSENEN. These complexes have tissue-specific roles in Notch signaling as demonstrated by experiments with MRK560 (Churcher et al, 2006; Best et al, 2006), a GSI that suppresses T-cell Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (Habets et al, 2019) without the classical Notch-related toxicity seen with broad spectrum GSIs\\u00a0in gut, skin or thymus. The compound MRK560 is selective for PSEN1 above PSEN2 \\u03b3-secretase, and PSEN2-\\u03b3-secretase is able to maintain the Notch physiological function in the gut and skin. The compound MRK560 was not further developed as a clinical candidate because of CYP2C9 inhibition liability (Zhao et al, 2015). Recent structural information explains the specificity of MRK560 at the molecular level (Guo et al, 2022; Serneels et al, 2023). It is thus possible to exploit the relatively small differences between the different complexes to make selective and more safe medication. In a recent comparison of 12 GSIs (Serneels et al, 2023), a few showed slight preference for APH1B over APH1A. New cryo-EM structures should explore the structural differences between APH1A or APH1B-containing complexes, which should help to generate specific drugs against APH1B-containing complexes; these are involved in amyloid plaque generation in an AD mouse model (Serneels et al, 2009). A pivotal study linked inherited forms of AD to missense mutations in S182, a gene of unknown function at that time (Sherrington et al, 1995). Soon thereafter, mutations in a second, homologous gene were identified (Rogaev et al, 1995). The genes were called PSEN1 (abbreviation for Presenilin 1) and PSEN2 to indicate their relationship with \\u201cpresenile\\u201d early-onset AD (Rogaev et al, 1995). The function of PSENs was completely unknown, but similarities with other genes encoding multi-transmembrane domain proteins led to spec\",\n",

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7. Both A\\u03b2 oligomers and plaques damage neurons by astrocytic activation, oxidative\",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced.

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) is triggering the disease. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavages of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. The latter cleavage by \\u03b3-secretase, a unique and fascinating four-component protease complex, occurs in the APP transmembrane domain thereby releasing A\\u03b2 species of 37-43 amino acids in length including the longer, highly pathogenic peptides A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243.

The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper &amp; Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018).

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma-secretase have faced challenges, as seen with the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat and avagacestat due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). However, ongoing research into the role of gamma-secretase in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction continues to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. The use of biomarkers, such as CSF Aβ levels, has also been investigated for their utility in assessing drug-target engagement in clinical settings (Steiner et al., 2018). Additionally, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity through selective inhibitors or modulators may provide a pathway for therapeutic intervention while minimizing side effects (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020).

In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2).

Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (5, 6), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatment with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (7), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (8\\u201312). The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD.

Mutations in the transmembrane domain of amyloid \\u03b2-protein precursor (APP) associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) can alter the ratio of aggregation-prone 42-residue A\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242) to 40-residue A\\u03b2 (A\\u03b240). However, APP substrate is proteolyzed processively by \\u03b3-secretase along two pathways: A\\u03b249\\u2192A\\u03b246\\u2192A\\u03b243\\u2192A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b248\\u2192A\\u03b245\\u2192A\\u03b242\\u2192A\\u03b238. Effects of FAD mutations on each proteolytic step are unknown, largely due to difficulties in detecting and quantifying longer A\\u03b2 peptides. To address this, we carried out systematic and quantitative analyses of all tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts from proteolysis of wild-type and 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by purified \\u03b3-secretase. These small peptides, including FAD-mutant forms, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by establishing concentration curves for each of 32 standards. APP intracellular domain (AICD) coproducts were quantified by immunoblot, and the ratio of AICD products corresponding to A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 was determined by mass spectrometry. Levels of individual A\\u03b2 peptides were determined by subtracting levels of peptide coproducts associated with degradation from those associated with production. This method was validated for A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 by specific ELISAs and production of equimolar levels of A\\u03b2 and AICD. Not all mutant substrates led to increased A\\u03b242/40. However, all 14 disease-causing mutations led to inefficient processing of longer forms of A\\u03b2 \\u2265 45 residues. In addition, the effects of certain mutations provided insight into the mechanism of processive proteolysis: intermediate A\\u03b2 peptides apparently remain bound for subsequent trimming and are not released and reassociated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nCerebral plaques composed of the amyloid \\u03b2-protein (A\\u03b2) are a defining pathological feature of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (1).

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",

      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",

Nevertheless, whether A\\u03b2 is the primary disease driver remains controversial. We report here that FAD mutations disrupt initial proteolytic events in the multistep processing of APP substrate C99 by \\u03b3-Secretase. Cryoelectron microscopy reveals that a substrate mimetic traps \\u03b3-Secretase during the transition state, and this structure aligns with activated enzyme-substrate complex captured by molecular dynamics simulations. In silico simulations and in cellulo fluorescence microscopy support stabilization of enzyme-substrate complexes by FAD mutations. Neuronal expression of C99 and/or presenilin-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to synaptic loss only with FAD-mutant transgenes.

The pathology, presentation, and progression of FAD are closely similar to those of the more common sporadic late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease,8,9 and the dominantly inherited monogenic nature of FAD suggests that elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms should be more tractable.

Several pathogenic changes in A\\u03b2 production can be observed when \\u03b3-secretase is gradually saturated with its substrate [7,10,13,14]. Saturation can be a result of different mechanisms that lead to a decrease in the catalytic capacity of \\u03b3-secretase [7]. Changes in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate can also significantly affect how the enzyme responds to potential drugs [6,9,11,12]. The earliest age of onset can be observed with mutants that have the best chance to reach saturation at the lowest substrate loads [7]. The protective islandic A673T mutation in the APP substrate is the only mutation that leads to a decrease in \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s saturation with its C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate [15]. Control of the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate can be a key physiological process [16]. The underlying mechanisms are still not understood [16]. Studies of the enzymatic mechanisms of \\u03b3-secretase have provided some surprising and fascinating insights about the disease, but they remain incomplete [17]. Frequent problems include inconsistent conclusions and irreproducible results. Accurate mechanistic interpretation depends on well-defined quantitative analysis [9,11,12,13]. Quantitative analysis of complex enzyme activity depends on accurate mathematical modeling [18,19,20,21,22], which can be challenging for complex enzymes [9,12,20]. Fortunately, computational studies of molecular structures can greatly simplify and advance interpretations of enzyme activity studies [8,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. We use advanced computational methods and \\u03b3-secretase structures to address some of the open questions in mechanistic studies of \\u03b3-secretase activity [7,9,10,11,13,30,31]. We found that \\u03b3-secretase can bind two different substrate molecules in parallel\\u2014one at the docking site and one at the active site [17,29,30]. The second substrate binds to the most dynamic sites in \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s structure that can be affected by disease-causing FAD mutations and by different drugs. The presented two-substrate mechanism can explain many of the pathogenic changes in \\u03b3-secretase activity at the molecular structural level. The presented molecular mechanism can be used for building correlations between different enzyme-based, cell-based, animal, and clinical studies of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [3,5,7,9,10,32]. Such correlations are crucial for the development of effective early diagnostic tools and drug development strategies [4]. C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules have highly dynamic structures that can be readily affected by the experimental conditions and can be difficult to measure [3,27,33,34,35,36,37]. We used multiscale MD studies to capture possible interactions between C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules in a cholesterol\\u2013lipid bilayer (Figure 1 and Figure 2) [38]. We started all MD studies by building a full-length C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP structure from the available NMR conformers (PDB: 2LP1 [33]; see Materials and Methods). The soluble N-terminal and C-terminal ends can readily fold into compact structures even when calculations start with the fully extended structures (Supplementary Video S1). Changes in Ramachandran angles show that the folded structures have transient loop and \\u03b2-sheet forms (Supplementary Figure S1). The transient folded structures are a result of competing interactions between different amino acids and polar lipid heads (Supplementary Figure S\",\n",

Transition-state analog inhibitors (TSAs) provided the first clue that the enzyme is an aspartyl protease, and affinity labeling reagents based on TSAs covalently bind to presenilin NTF and CTF, early evidence that the active site resides between these two subunits. TSAs also helped characterize active site pockets and suggested the existence of a separate initial substrate docking exosite. Helical peptide inhibitors (HPIs) designed to interact with this docking site identified the presenilin NTF/CTF interface as its location and close proximity to the active site. More recently, linking HPI to TSA has provided full substrate TMD-based stoichiometric inhibitors as structural probes for cryo-EM analysis to trap the protease complex in its transition state for intramembrane proteolysis. Full substrate TMD-based functional probes have also been developed to facilitate analysis of all proteolytic products generated during the complex processing of APP substrate by \\u03b3-secretase. Toward therapeutics targeting \\u03b3-secretase, a wide variety of small-molecule inhibitors (GSIs) and modulators (GSMs) have been reported, with some going through clinical trials. GSIs can effectively lower A\\u03b2 production in vivo. However, GSIs also interfere with critical Notch signaling, causing severe side effects. More concerning, GSIs cause cognitive worsening. These devastating failures of GSIs in late-stage clinical trials has turned the field toward GSMs. Modulation rather than inhibition appears to be safe and allows specific targeting of A\\u03b242. These compounds apparently stimulate the A\\u03b242\\u219238 trimming step, to lower the aggregation-prone peptide. Whether GSMs will prevent AD remains to be determined, however.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

We analyze the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate using multiscale molecular dynamics studies. We found that an increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate could result in the parallel binding of different substrate molecules at the docking site and the active site. The C-terminal domain of the substrate bound at the docking site can interact with the most dynamic presenilin sites at the cytosolic end of the active site tunnel. Such interactions can inhibit the ongoing catalytic activity and increase the production of the longer, more hydrophobic, and more toxic A\\u03b2 proteins. Similar disruptions in dynamic presenilin structures can be observed with different drugs and disease-causing mutations. Both, C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and its different A\\u03b2 products, can support the toxic aggregation. The aggregation depends on the substrate N-terminal domain. Thus, the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b2-secretase path can be more toxic than the C83-\\u03b1CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b1-secretase path. Nicastrin can control the toxic aggregation in the closed conformation. The binding of the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate to \\u03b3-secretase can be controlled by substrate channeling between the nicastrin and \\u03b2-secretase.

Alzheimer\\u2019s disease stands out among other malignant diseases as imposing the greatest financial burden on healthcare providers in developed countries [1,3,4].

Cerebral neurodegeneration typically takes place first in the hippocampus, a region below the neocortex that is critical for consolidating long-term memories. Neuronal loss spreads to other cortical areas, leading to progressive cognitive decline. By the end stages of the disease, patients lose cognitive function to the point of requiring constant care, often institutionalized. Although a number of risk factors have been associated with AD, disease onset correlates best with age, and the large majority of cases occur in the elderly. Among people over age 85, over a third are afflicted. Two types of protein deposits are found in the AD brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2]. The former are extraneuronal and primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), whereas the latter are intraneuronal filaments of the normally microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuroinflammation is a third pathological feature of AD, in which microglia\\u2014phagocytic brain immune cells that release cytokines\\u2014become overactivated [3]. The role of each of these features in AD etiology and pathogenesis are not well understood. However, A\\u03b2 aggregation\\u2014in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques\\u2014is generally observed as the earliest pathology, followed by tau tangle formation and neurodegeneration [4]. For this reason and those mentioned in the next section, pathological A\\u03b2 is widely considered the initiator of AD, triggering downstream tau pathology and neuroinflammation, and A\\u03b2 has been the primary target for the development of AD therapeutics for over 25 years [5].

The presented two-substrate mechanism can explain how disruptions in the optimal balance between \\u03b3-secretase activity and A\\u03b2 metabolism can lead to toxic events in all different sporadic and FAD cases of the disease (Figure 9). A well-defined molecular mechanism that can connect different causes of the disease is crucial for the development of effective early diagnostic tools and drugs [19]. Drug development studies were among the first to indicate that \\u03b3-secretase has two substrate-binding sites [8,9,12,17,30]. Here, we show that the second substrate can affect the sites that bind different drugs (Supplementary Video S3). Such results are consistent with previous studies showing that a gradual increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate can affect how \\u03b3-secretase responds to drugs [6,7,9,11,12]. Drugs can lead to increases in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate [9,89]. Drugs, just like increasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase, can affect the A\\u03b2 (x-42)/A\\u03b2 (x-40) ratio [11,13]. FAD mutations can affect how drugs bind to \\u03b3-secretase [7,10]. Drugs, FAD mutations, and the second substrate can affect the most dynamic parts in the presenilin structure that control processive catalysis (Supplementary Videos S3 and S4). The presented insights indicate that the first possible improvement in future drug development strategies could be the development of competitive inhibitors of \\u03b3-secretase [19]. These competitive inhibitors could mimic the effects of the protective A673T mutation, i.e., decreasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate [15,19]. Attempts to design competitive inhibitors that target the active site have been challenging. The attempts to target the active site with peptide analogs have been unsuccessful due to the surprisingly long and flexible active site tunnel [8,9,12,23]. Our results indicate three alternative strategies for the development of competitive inhibitors: First, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to facilitate the closure of the nicastrin ectodomain (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). Second, the competitive inhibitors could compete with the formation of \\u03b2-secretase\\u2013\\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 8). Third, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules and control its dimerization ([33,34,37] and Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 7). The development of compounds that target C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules is extremely difficult [39]. C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP has a highly dynamic structure and, thus, represents a poorly defined target for effective drug development efforts (Figure 1 and Figure 2 [33,34,37]). The prepared drugs have to compete with other molecules that bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP with high affinity ([37] and Figure 1C). The second major improvement in drug development strategies could be an expansion of the future target list. Compounds that can decrease the catalytic capacity of \\u03b3-secretase can be used to trace different physiological processes that control \\u03b3-secretase activity and amyloid metabolism at pre-symptomatic stages of the disease (Figure 9). Briefly, compounds such as semagacestat and avagacestat can be used in healthy animals to gradually induce pathogenesis, by provoking gradual saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate (Figure 9 [7,9]).

The MultiBac baculovirus protein expression system has enabled, the use of a single baculovirus to reconstitute a protein complex of interest, resulting in a larger protein yield. Using this system, we aimed to reconstruct the gamma (\\u03b3)-secretase complex, a multiprotein enzyme complex essential for the production of amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) protein. A MultiBac vector containing all components of the \\u03b3-secretase complex was generated and expression was observed for all components. The complex was active in processing APP and Notch derived \\u03b3-secretase substrates and proteolysis could be inhibited with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, confirming specificity of the recombinant \\u03b3-secretase enzyme. Finally, affinity purification was used to purify an active recombinant \\u03b3-secretase complex. In this study we demonstrated that the MultiBac protein expression system can be used to generate an active \\u03b3-secretase complex and provides a new tool to study \\u03b3-secretase enzyme and its variants.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nMulti-protein complexes have vital roles in many cellular functions1,2. One such complex is the transmembrane \\u03b3-secretase enzyme that is responsible for proteolytically cleaving numerous Type I transmembrane proteins2,3. For example, Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is proteolytically cleaved by \\u03b3-secretase to generate various A\\u03b2 peptides, some of which have been shown to accumulate in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) brains4. Amyloidogenic processing of APP is initiated by \\u03b2-APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) that cleaves the ectodomain of APP to generate a membrane embedded APP C-terminal fragment (C99). This APP-C99 fragment is subsequently processed by \\u03b3-secretase to generate multiple A\\u03b2 peptides and the APP intracellular domain (AICD)5. The generation and accumulation of longer A\\u03b2 peptides (e.g. A\\u03b242) plays a key role in the events that lead to neurodegeneration in the AD brain6. Therefore, \\u03b3-secretase is a logical target for the development of inhibitors/modulators aimed at lowering A\\u03b2 production. However, the complexity of the enzyme and its ability to process many different substrates have hindered targeted, therapeutic development efforts. Undesirable off-target effects related to disruption of Notch signalling are observed in animal and human trials7\\u201310, therefore highlighting a need for a better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s structure and function. The enzyme consists of a combination of multi-pass transmembrane proteins, Presenilin (PS1 or PS2), Nicastrin (NCT), Anterior Pharynx Homologue 1 (APH1a [long/short isoform] and APH1b in human and in addition Aph1c in mice) and Presenilin Enhancer 2 (PEN-2). Although high-resolution structural studies11\\u201315 have provided an insight into the process of \\u03b3-secretase assembly and activity, additional information is still required. An understanding of the flexible domains of \\u03b3-secretase that are responsible for recognition, selection, sorting and shuttling substrate to the active site16,17 is required. Sampling of different dynamic conformations of \\u03b3-secretase11,13,14, will provide us with an insight into the molecular mechanism18 essential for substrate\",\n",

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92.

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

Interestingly, mutations in PS1 change the localization toward that of PS2-containing complexes (67). After the discovery of \\u03b3-secretase, a huge amount of research was carried out to develop potent and bioavailable \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), but the clinical trials based on these inhibitors all failed (Table\\u00a01). Indeed, none of them led to improvement of AD-linked cognitive decline and even sometimes they worsened them. In most of these trials, A\\u03b2 levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly decreased, thus clearly indicating that a reduction in total A\\u03b2 was not sufficient to restore cognitive function. This was the case for Semagacestat, the first GSI tested in late-stage clinical trials for AD, which was reported to reduce A\\u03b2 levels by more than 60% in the plasma (110), and new A\\u03b2 synthesis was decreased by more than 80% in CSF (111). More alarming, many trials were readily stopped because of increased risk of developing skin cancer and infections, which was supposed to be tightly linked to a defective Notch signaling in the presence of the inhibitors (112). Therefore, several groups started to screen for drugs having a higher affinity for APP than toward Notch, such as Avagacestat, initially reported to be 140-fold more selective for APP than Notch (113), although its Notch sparing ability remains controversial (114, 115). Avagacestat led to a 40% A\\u03b2 reduction in CSF (Table\\u00a01), but demonstrated similar side effects in clinical trials (116). Therefore, due to the huge number of different \\u03b3-secretase substrates, it has appeared difficult to target specifically and exclusively the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated APP cleavage. Furthermore, data from preclinical trials proposed that the lack of efficacy, or even worsening, of cognitive function in these trials was also linked to the progressive accumulation of APP-CTFs in the presence of GSIs (117). To avoid such effects, therapeutic development became focused on \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that were expected to be safer, since they interact with \\u03b3-secretase complex through the allosteric binding site, thereby modifying the enzyme activity but not blocking it (118). The concept of \\u03b3-secretase modulation was discovered with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, which are considered as GSMs, because they induce conformational changes in PS1 and shift the cleavage of C99 toward shorter A\\u03b2 species such as A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 (16, 119). In that way, GSMs do not lead to increased APP-CTFs levels. Indeed, in AD animal models, the chronic treatment with GSMs did not lead to the worsening of cognitive function observed with GSIs (117). Moreover, GSMs are also safer because they reduce the level of A\\u03b242 and increase shorter A\\u03b2 peptides without affecting Notch signaling (120, 121). Nonetheless, the first GSMs tested in clinical trials, Rofecoxib (122), Tarenflurbil (123) or Naproxen (124), did not show efficacy, but the lack of effects seemed to be related to a very poor blood\\u2013brain barrier crossing ability of these drugs (Table\\u00a01). Thus, taken together, \\u03b3-secretase-based strategies have so far been unsuccessful, even if GSMs seem to be more promising (125). Still, if considering \\u03b3\",\n",

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",

      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma-secretase have faced challenges, as seen with the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat and avagacestat due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in patients (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). However, ongoing research into the role of gamma-secretase in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction continues to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. The use of biomarkers, such as CSF Aβ levels, has also been investigated for their utility in assessing drug-target engagement in clinical settings (Steiner et al., 2018). Additionally, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity through selective inhibitors or modulators may provide a pathway for therapeutic intervention while minimizing side effects (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "Effective treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease may require a nuanced approach to modulating gamma-secretase activity. This includes the development of substrate-specific inhibitors that can reduce toxic Aβ production while preserving essential functions of the gamma-secretase complex (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Additionally, exploring gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to correct presenilin mutations offers a promising avenue for future therapies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression (Steiner et al., 2018). The integration of findings linking Aβ42 levels and gamma-secretase inhibition into therapeutic strategies could provide new insights into managing AD effectively (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4.

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4].

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

However, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, indicating liver toxicity, were also observed, and further development of BMS-932,481 was discontinued [72]. In the previous year, one of the oxidative products of BMS-932,481 was identified as the primary metabolite found in rat and human liver microsomes [73]. The authors hypothesized that the conversion of BMS-932,481 to this metabolite, in which an alcohol was substituted at the C-5 position, led to the formation of reactive species which could result in liver injury. Development of GSM derivatives from this group focused on blocking the metabolism at the C-5 position have yet to be reported. A collaboration between the University of California San Diego and Massachusetts General Hospital synthesized and characterized a series of pyridazine-derived GSM analogs [74]. The top candidate UCSD-776,890 reduced A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 in a dose-dependent manner across acute, subchronic, and chronic dosing studies in multiple species. In prophylactic and disease-modifying regimens administered to 3 and 6\\u00a0month AD transgenic mice respectively, UCSD-776,890 reduced plasma and brain A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 as well as amyloid deposition and microgliosis. Additionally, based on comparison of systemic exposure the compound at 50% effective equivalent human dose is expected to have over a 130-fold safety margin. These studies demonstrate the possibility for small molecule GSMs to be safely administered as secondary prevention in genetically predisposed subjects, or at-risk subjects who are amyloid-positive based on PET imaging. UCSD-776,890 is currently being prepared for phase I studies. The ability to image amyloid and CSF biomarkers in human subjects has been crucial to monitoring the progress of clinical trials in AD [75]. A PET radiotracer based on pyridazine-derived GSM BPN-15606 demonstrated good brain uptake and selectivity for imaging PS1/ \\u03b3-secretase in brains of AD transgenic mice [76]. Elevated brain uptake in AD mice was observed in several critical regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, and mid-brain compared to wild-type mice. Interestingly, imaging studies in the brains of rodents and nonhuman primates revealed overlapping areas of higher uptake, pointing to conservation of \\u03b3-secretase activity. The GSM-based probe is a valuable molecular imaging tool which can be applied to further investigate physiological \\u03b3-secretase structure\\u2013function and potentially optimized as a radiotracer in AD patients. For many years, structural and functional insights of \\u03b3-secretase came from chemical probes derived from GSIs and GSMs [57, 77]. Photoaffinity labeling (PAL) has been a valuable tool for target identification of small molecules [78]. Photoaffinity probes, or photoprobes, contain a photoreactive group which crosslinks to binding targets upon UV irradiation and a reporter tag which enables purification or monitoring of the target.

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Steiner et al., 2018). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Steiner et al., 2018). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (De Strooper & Karran, 2024). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Steiner et al., 2018).\n",

The introduction of the amyloid beta hypothesis provided directions for the development and testing of therapeutic agents for disease modification, which mutually enhance clearance of toxic peptides out of the brain and prevent A\\u03b2 formation [16]. Unfortunately, >400 clinical trials conducted over the decade when the last drug for AD was approved have failed. The drug only offered temporary treatment for AD symptoms. A significantly high attrition rate was indicated by an analysis of various clinical trials involving AD between 2002 and 2012, with a mere overall success rate of only 0.4%, with a 99.5% failure rate [11]. Despite the many plausible reasons behind the failure of these clinical trials, a widely-agreed view is that the disease stage was too advanced for any anti-A\\u03b2 drugs to impact cognition. Due to the considerable failure on present approaches focused on modifying the disease, other probable treatment methodologies, such as genome editing techniques, are needed. Currently, there are three major prevalent gene editing tools available, including CRISPR/Cas9, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs). Each of these tools has its own merits and demerits [17]. However, the present review mainly elaborates on the possible role of CRISPR/Cas9 in AD due to its low cost, high speed, efficiency, and precision over other genome editing tools. CRISPR/Cas9 is a recently discovered and promising revolutionary tool for genome editing, which allows to treat diseases with limited or scarce treatment options. This tool was initially identified by Ishino in 1987 [18] (Fig. 2). Since then, several studies have reported that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is an integral part of a bacterium's immune system, which offers protection from undesired integration of mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and viruses. Further, Doudna and Charpentier\\u2019s pioneering efforts brought CRISPR/Cas9 to laboratory settings to investigate its potential [19]. In-depth studies on CRISPR/Cas9 have been conducted in the recent past, and significantly improved editing efficiency and minimized off-target effects while being extensively used for basic and translational research [19], [20].Fig. 2The CRISPR/Cas9 timeline, crRNA: CRISPR-derived RNA; CRISPR/Cas9, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins 9 system. The CRISPR/Cas9 timeline, crRNA: CRISPR-derived RNA; CRISPR/Cas9, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins 9 system. CRISPR/Cas9 has two main components: the Cas9 enzyme and single-guide RNA (sgRNA). The target DNA sequence is recognized by the sgRNA, wherein various parameters are considered in the design process to improve specificity. In contrast, as an endonuclease, the Cas9 protein acts as a molecular scissor for incision of the DNA double strands (Fig. 3). CRISPR/Cas systems are classified into Class 1 (type I, type III, and type IV) and Class 2 (type II, type V, and type VI). Class 1 contains a variety of Cas proteins that work together, whereas Class 2 utilizes a single Cas protein, which makes it simple and desirable for genome editing [21]. Among Class 2, the type II CRISPR/Cas9 system is one of the most researched and utilized systems in\",\n",

The M146L mutation in the PS1 gene (PSEN1) leads to an autosomal dominant form of early-onset AD by promoting a relative increase in the generation of the more aggregation-prone A\\u03b242. This change is evident not only in the brain\\u00a0but also in peripheral cells of mutation carriers. In this study we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes to selectively disrupt the PSEN1M146L allele in human fibroblasts. A disruption of more than 50% of mutant alleles was observed in all CRISPR-Cas9-treated samples, resulting in reduced extracellular A\\u03b242/40 ratios. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based conformation and western blot analyses indicated that CRISPR-Cas9 treatment also affects the overall PS1 conformation and reduces PS1 levels. Moreover, our guide RNA did not lead to any detectable editing at the highest-ranking candidate off-target sites identified by ONE-seq and CIRCLE-seq. Overall, our data support the effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas9 in selectively targeting the PSEN1M146L allele and counteracting the AD-associated phenotype. We believe that this system could be developed into a therapeutic strategy for patients with this and other dominant mutations leading to early-onset AD. As a novel approach for treatment of early-onset familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of PSEN1 in human fibroblasts with the pathogenic PSEN1 M146L mutation can partially restore the disease-associated amyloid-\\u03b2 42/40 increase, as well as reduce presenilin 1 levels.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and affects more than 50 million people worldwide.1 Sporadic, late-onset AD accounts for more than 95% of the total number of patients, whereas familial early-onset AD (EOAD) represents less than 5% of the cases.2 Early-onset disease forms are associated with symptoms already in the fifth and sixth decades of life and are caused by autosomal dominant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2), respectively. The pathogenic effects of all mutations converge toward an increased generation or altered conformation of amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b2), the peptide that accumulates as plaques in the AD brain.

Currently, research on the pathological mechanism of AD has been elucidated for decades, still no effective treatment for this complex disease was developed, and the existing therapeutic strategies are extremely erratic, thereby leading to irreversible and progressive cognitive decline in AD patients. Due to gradually mental dyscapacitating of AD patients, AD not only brings serious physical and psychological suffering to patients themselves, but also imposes huge economic burdens on family and society. Accordingly, it is very imperative to recapitulate the progress of gene editing-based precision medicine in the emerging fields. In this review, we will mainly focus on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technique in the fields of AD research and gene therapy, and summarize the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in the aspects of AD model construction, screening of pathogenic genes, and target therapy. Finally, the development of delivery systems, which is a major challenge that hinders the clinical application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology will also be discussed.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behavior, social deficits, and an eventual inability to perform daily tasks. It is predicted that by 2050, the number of Alzheimer\\u2019s patients aged 65 years and older in the U.S. may reach 13.8 million (No authors listed, 2020). In China, more than 15.07 million people aged 60 years or older have dementia, and approximately 9.83 million of them suffer from AD (Jia et al., 2020). Accordingly, so many AD patients will bring major public health challenges. And to make matters worse, the pathogenesis of AD is currently still unclear. Until now, \\u03b2-amyloid protein deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation are widely regarded as key contributions to the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD (Mila-Aloma et al., 2020; Zetterberg and Bendlin, 2021). Besides, other age-related, protective, and disease-promoting factors probably interact with the core mechanisms of AD and may be involved in the onset of AD. For instance, emerging extensive research has shown that some disregarded partners such as vascular dysfunction (Sweeney et al., 2019), oxidative stress (Tonnies and Trushina, 2017), proteinopathy (Sharma and Kim, 2021), metal ions (Huang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019b), neuroinflammation (Calsolaro and Edison, 2016), mitochondrial dysfunction (Mantzavinos and Alexiou, 2017; Perez Ortiz and Swerdl\",\n",

Epigenetics could play a role in several diseases, including AD, and studying the epigenetic modifications could be helpful in understanding the disease mechanism.90,91 In addition, the generation of new model systems based on CRISPR/Cas9 including iPSC-derived in vitro models will provide a route to understanding cell type-specific gene function and its networks in the brain with more precision. Furthermore, along with whole/exome genome sequencing and GWAS, in vitro genome editing holds potential for personalized therapeutic applications for patients with AD. Recently, several commercially available products for CRISPR\\u2013Cas9 are beginning to provide convenient and effective methods to generate gene knock-outs/ins using programmable nucleases. The newly developed CRISPR\\u2013Cas9 technology will not only support the development of genetic models of AD but also enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of the related disorders including Parkinson\\u2019s and Huntington\\u2019s diseases, all of which have become more prevalent as the life expectancy of humans has increased.92 Novel genome editing technologies based on the CRISPR\\u2013 Cas9 system together with powerful readout methods might help us better understand the logic of neuronal circuits and unravel some of the mysteries of AD and dementias in general in the near future.\\n\",\n",

However, these verification studies tend to be expensive, time consuming, and inconsistent. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR\\u2013Cas9) system was developed, which improves sequence-specific gene editing in cell lines, organs, and animals. CRISPR\\u2013Cas9 is a promising tool for the generation of models of human genetic diseases and could facilitate the establishment of new animal AD models and the observation of dynamic bioprocesses in AD.

Nevertheless, whether A\\u03b2 is the primary disease driver remains controversial. We report here that FAD mutations disrupt initial proteolytic events in the multistep processing of APP substrate C99 by \\u03b3-Secretase. Cryoelectron microscopy reveals that a substrate mimetic traps \\u03b3-Secretase during the transition state, and this structure aligns with activated enzyme-substrate complex captured by molecular dynamics simulations. In silico simulations and in cellulo fluorescence microscopy support stabilization of enzyme-substrate complexes by FAD mutations. Neuronal expression of C99 and/or presenilin-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to synaptic loss only with FAD-mutant transgenes.

In the management of AD, CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing holds promise. Although efficient and safe delivery systems are still lacking, it is a vast task that requires translation of this technological approach into real therapeutic applications. To date, viral and non-viral methodologies for the delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 systems are available. The use of viral vectors for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 is a classical method in experimental models, including cell lines and animals, and one of the most dynamic systems for the targeted delivery of plasmid-based CRISPR/Cas9. Moreover, they may incorporate mutations that have significant adverse effects. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) are a frequently used vector because of its high infectivity, low immunogenicity, and low integration into the human genome [24], [25]. With\\u00a0>\\u00a0200 variants, the AAV genome comprises single-stranded DNA [26]. One study reported the use of two separate AAV vectors packaging APPsw-specific gRNA and Cas9 targeting the AD-causing KM670/671NL APP mutation. The viruses were tested in vitro in primary neuronal cells from Tg2576 mouse embryos and in vivo via intrahippocampal injection in Tg2576 mice. This treatment reduced A\\u03b2 generation by approximately 60% in human fibroblasts [38]. Due to the low packing capability of the 4.7\\u00a0kb of AAV, co-injections of two viruses might be required. However, this would further complicate the procedure as both can not concurrently infect the same cell. Lentivirus incorporate long DNA inserts comprising 8\\u201310\\u00a0kb but with lower brain disseminating efficiency [27]. But, contrary to AAV, lentiviruses cannot be so easily produced in large quantities, and can be incorporated into the human genome, thereby provoking immune reactions [25]. However, studies have demonstrated the possible use of lentivirus to target three genes, namely, APOE4, APP, and caspase-6, in SAD and familial AD [28], [29], [30]. Non-viral vectors have been found promising for the targeted delivery of CRISPR/Cas9, attributed to better cost effectiveness, relative ease, feasibility, and flexibility. Consequently, they are extremely suitable for application in AD. It is very easy\",\n",

Approximately 50 million individuals are affected by AD, and the number is rapidly increasing globally. This review explores the role of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the management of AD and its clinical manifestations.

However, we have referred to its use against parkinsons\\u2019s disease (PD), Huntington\\u2019s disease (HD), and other human diseases, as is one of the most promising and emerging technologies for disease treatment. The pathophysiology of AD is known to be linked with gene mutations, that is, presenilin (PSEN) and amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). However, clinical trials focused at the genetic level could not meet the desired efficiency. The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool is one of the most powerful technologies for correcting inconsistent genetic signatures and now extensively used for AD management.

The M146L gRNA did not lead to indel formation in any of the top ten predicted off-target loci (modification <1%). At present, there is no cure for AD and current treatments are palliative rather than targeting the underlying causes of the disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists have been proven to relieve some of the cognitive symptoms30 and delay placement in nursing homes.31 As for therapies directed against the underlying disease pathology, in June 2021 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved aducanumab (Aduhelm) as the first ever immunotherapy treatment designed against toxic forms of A\\u03b2.32 Another monoclonal antibody, lecanemab, targeting toxic A\\u03b2 protofibrils, has shown promise in a phase II clinical trial.33 Inhibitors of the secretase complexes involved in APP processing have also been extensively studied as potential therapeutic targets. However, the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors were found to cause severe side effects in late-stage clinical trials, presumably due to the large number of substrates that this enzyme recognizes.34,35 In this study we aimed to specifically target presenilin 1, the catalytic subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex, at the genetic level, thereby avoiding any issues with substrate specificity. Gene therapies against several neurological diseases have emerged in the past 5 years. In 2019 the FDA approved the first ever gene therapy for a neurological disorder, spinal muscular atrophy,36 and in 2020 the first gene-editing clinical trial where CRISPR components were administered directly to patients entered its phase I stage against the rare eye disorder Leber\\u2019s congenital amaurosis.37 More recently, a clinical trial using CRISPR-Cas9 against hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis also entered the phase I stage in the first clinical trial for gene therapies of amyloid-related diseases.38 With regard to AD, no studies in humans have been initiated, but systemic delivery of CRISPR components in transgenic human APP mice showed robust indel formation in the brain, reduction in A\\u03b2-associated pathologies, and improvement in cognitive performance.39 Early-onset AD is caused by mutations in autosomal dominant genes, making it an ideal candidate for gene-editing strategies. Several studies have pointed out how various PSEN1 and APP mutations lead to pathogenic phenotypes in isogenic human cell lines and how substitution of the mutant with the wild-type allele can reverse that pathology.40, 41, 42 Most PSEN1 mutations, such as PSEN1 M146L, lead to increased production of the more aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 that is known to form A\\u03b2 plaques in the AD brain. By selectively targeting such mutations, we might be able to counteract the increase in A\\u03b242/40 ratio and thereby prevent the progression of A\\u03b2 pathology. Previously, it has been shown that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated correction of neurons derived from human PSEN2 N141I fibroblasts resulted in normalization of the A\\u03b242/40 ratio as well as rescue of the associated electrophysiological deficits.43 In our current study we describe an allele-specific approach for targeting the PSEN1M146L allele in human fibroblasts with the CRISPR-Cas9 system that is based on disruption rather than correction of the mutated allele. The M146L mutation leads to the generation of a novel PAM site in the sequence of the mutated allele that allowed us to design a gRNA that selectively disrupts the PSEN1M146L allele while leaving the PSEN1WT allele intact. Although the NHEJ pathway results in random indel formation, it can be very useful for targeting autosomal dominant mutations where disruption of the mutated allele could potentially suffice for phenotype restoration.25 The precise targeting of the mutated over the wild-type allele is of great significance, and gRNA\",\n",

Until so far, no mutations have been found in \\u03b2-secretase, but the Swedish and the Leuven APP mutations are known to shift the cleavage from the \\u03b2\\u2032-site to the \\u03b2-site, thus leading to a much higher C99 and A\\u03b2 production (12, 13, 37, 38). Inversely, the Icelandic mutation (A673T) seems to be protective against AD by decreasing \\u03b2-secretase cleavage and thus reducing by 40% the amyloidogenic fragments sAPP\\u03b2 and A\\u03b2 (17, 39). The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50). Further studies also revealed a very complex cleavage of APP-CTFs by \\u03b3-secretase, since it takes place within the membrane and successively at several sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6-, \\u03b3- and \\u03b3\\u2032). The first endopeptidase cleavage (\\u025b-cleavage) can occur at two distinct sites leading to the generation of A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249, which is then shortened by sequential carboxypeptidase cleavages (trimming) at \\u03b6, \\u03b3-and \\u03b3\\u2032-sites, occurring at each three or four residues and via two distinct product lines (A\\u03b249 > A\\u03b246 > A\\u03b243 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b237) or (A\\u03b248 > A\\u03b245 > A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b238) and the final occurrence of peptides of varying lengths but two major species of 40 or 42 amino acid residues, respectively (51).

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (Bhardwaj et al., 2021). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Evangelos et al., 2022). Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of Aβ42 in the endolysosomal compartment inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Bhardwaj et al., 2021). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Evangelos et al., 2022). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Bhardwaj et al., 2021). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (Evangelos et al., 2022). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Bhardwaj et al., 2021). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Evangelos et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Bhardwaj et al., 2021). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Evangelos et al., 2022).\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with GPR3 KO mice also decreased A\\u03b2 production, and GPR3 was expressed in the brains of SAD patients92.

Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211. Hur et al.158 showed that IFITM3 binds to PS1-NTF in active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production (A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242) (Fig. 6).

Single and long-term daily dosing studies demonstrated dose-dependent increases in CSF A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 and corresponding decreases in CSF A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 without changes in total A\\u03b2. However, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, indicating liver toxicity, were also observed, and further development of BMS-932,481 was discontinued [72]. In the previous year, one of the oxidative products of BMS-932,481 was identified as the primary metabolite found in rat and human liver microsomes [73]. The authors hypothesized that the conversion of BMS-932,481 to this metabolite, in which an alcohol was substituted at the C-5 position, led to the formation of reactive species which could result in liver injury. Development of GSM derivatives from this group focused on blocking the metabolism at the C-5 position have yet to be reported. A collaboration between the University of California San Diego and Massachusetts General Hospital synthesized and characterized a series of pyridazine-derived GSM analogs [74]. The top candidate UCSD-776,890 reduced A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 in a dose-dependent manner across acute, subchronic, and chronic dosing studies in multiple species. In prophylactic and disease-modifying regimens administered to 3 and 6\\u00a0month AD transgenic mice respectively, UCSD-776,890 reduced plasma and brain A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 as well as amyloid deposition and microgliosis. Additionally, based on comparison of systemic exposure the compound at 50% effective equivalent human dose is expected to have over a 130-fold safety margin. These studies demonstrate the possibility for small molecule GSMs to be safely administered as secondary prevention in genetically predisposed subjects, or at-risk subjects who are amyloid-positive based on PET imaging. UCSD-776,890 is currently being prepared for phase I studies. The ability to image amyloid and CSF biomarkers in human subjects has been crucial to monitoring the progress of clinical trials in AD [75]. A PET radiotracer based on pyridazine-derived GSM BPN-15606 demonstrated good brain uptake and selectivity for imaging PS1/ \\u03b3-secretase in brains of AD transgenic mice [76]. Elevated brain uptake in AD mice was observed in several critical regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, and mid-brain compared to wild-type mice. Interestingly, imaging studies in the brains of rodents and nonhuman primates revealed overlapping areas of higher uptake, pointing to conservation of \\u03b3-secretase activity. The GSM-based probe is a valuable molecular imaging tool which can be applied to further investigate physiological \\u03b3-secretase structure\\u2013function and potentially optimized as a radiotracer in AD patients. For many years, structural and functional insights of \\u03b3-secretase came from chemical probes derived from GSIs and GSMs [57, 77]. Photoaffinity labeling (PAL) has been a valuable tool for target identification of small molecules [78]. Photoaffinity probes, or photoprobes, contain a photoreactive group which crosslinks to binding targets upon UV irradiation and a reporter tag which enables purification or monitoring of the target.

We also discuss the chemical biology of \\u03b3-secretase, in which small molecule probes enabled structural and functional insights into \\u03b3-secretase before the emergence of high-resolution structural studies. Finally, we discuss the recent crystal structures of \\u03b3-secretase, which have provided valuable perspectives on substrate recognition and molecular mechanisms of small molecules.

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4].

We analyze the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate using multiscale molecular dynamics studies. We found that an increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate could result in the parallel binding of different substrate molecules at the docking site and the active site. The C-terminal domain of the substrate bound at the docking site can interact with the most dynamic presenilin sites at the cytosolic end of the active site tunnel. Such interactions can inhibit the ongoing catalytic activity and increase the production of the longer, more hydrophobic, and more toxic A\\u03b2 proteins. Similar disruptions in dynamic presenilin structures can be observed with different drugs and disease-causing mutations. Both, C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and its different A\\u03b2 products, can support the toxic aggregation. The aggregation depends on the substrate N-terminal domain. Thus, the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b2-secretase path can be more toxic than the C83-\\u03b1CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b1-secretase path. Nicastrin can control the toxic aggregation in the closed conformation.

Alzheimer\\u2019s disease stands out among other malignant diseases as imposing the greatest financial burden on healthcare providers in developed countries [1,3,4]. Impressive drug development efforts have been mostly centered on the metabolism of the last 99 amino acids of the amyloid precursor protein (C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP) [3,4]. Based on strong genetic results, the most frequent therapeutic targets are two aspartic proteases: membrane-anchored \\u03b2-secretase, and membrane-embedded \\u03b3-secretase [2,3,5].

Compounds with different structures, different binding sites, different mechanisms of action, and different pharmacological properties have shown very impressive nanomolar potency [1,4,5].

While these structural studies will need to be supported by experimental data, they can be applied towards rational design of the next generation GSIs and GSMs for AD therapeutics. While targeting \\u03b3-secretase has proven challenging, it should not diminish its potential as a crucial target for AD pathogenesis. The serious toxicities that halted clinical studies of GSIs demonstrated there were many knowledge gaps about \\u03b3-secretase biology and underestimation of its nuanced proteolysis before the compounds were evaluated in humans [49]. GSMs aim to stimulate \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s carboxypeptidase-like trimming of A\\u03b2 peptides to their shorter, less pathogenic forms. Over the past two decades, industry and academic groups have optimized the potency and CNS penetration of GSMs, several of which have started clinical trials. The success of small molecule GSMs, as with other A\\u03b2-targeted therapies, also depend on being administered in the early stages of AD pathology well before clinical manifestations. Amyloid-based biomarkers and diagnostics will be vital to identifying and monitoring trial subjects. The development of the first GSM-based radiotracer suggests that that \\u03b3-secretase expression could be monitored in AD patients. In the past several years, detailed structures of \\u03b3-secretase have emerged. These structures have already been used in computational docking studies for GSMs [91]. Modeling GSMs with varying chemotypes could be insightful for comparing their mechanisms of recognizing and altering substrate and enzyme transmembrane domains. The latest \\u03b3-secretase structures bound to GSIs and E2012 offer a wealth of information for the design and lead optimization of more potent and substrate-selective small molecules. Drug combinations using drugs which act on distinct targets or show different mechanisms of action have been commonly been used in cancer [92]. A few combination therapies could involve (1) distinct structural classes of GSMs (2) GSMs and inhibitors of tau in neurofibrillary tangles, and (3) GSMs and agents which stimulate A\\u03b2 clearance.

Cerebral neurodegeneration typically takes place first in the hippocampus, a region below the neocortex that is critical for consolidating long-term memories. Neuronal loss spreads to other cortical areas, leading to progressive cognitive decline. By the end stages of the disease, patients lose cognitive function to the point of requiring constant care, often institutionalized. Although a number of risk factors have been associated with AD, disease onset correlates best with age, and the large majority of cases occur in the elderly. Among people over age 85, over a third are afflicted. Two types of protein deposits are found in the AD brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2]. The former are extraneuronal and primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), whereas the latter are intraneuronal filaments of the normally microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuroinflammation is a third pathological feature of AD, in which microglia\\u2014phagocytic brain immune cells that release cytokines\\u2014become overactivated [3]. The role of each of these features in AD etiology and pathogenesis are not well understood. However, A\\u03b2 aggregation\\u2014in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques\\u2014is generally observed as the earliest pathology, followed by tau tangle formation and neurodegeneration [4]. For this reason and those mentioned in the next section, pathological A\\u03b2 is widely considered the initiator of AD, triggering downstream tau pathology and neuroinflammation, and A\\u03b2 has been the primary target for the development of AD therapeutics for over 25 years [5].

In contrast, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) like flurbiprofen are shown to induce shifts towards shorter A\\u03b2 species without increasing APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and do not negatively impact Notch signaling. Despite this, early GSM clinical trials showed poor efficacy due to limited blood-brain barrier penetration.\\n\\n7\": {\n",

Interestingly, mutations in PS1 change the localization toward that of PS2-containing complexes (67). After the discovery of \\u03b3-secretase, a huge amount of research was carried out to develop potent and bioavailable \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), but the clinical trials based on these inhibitors all failed (Table\\u00a01). Indeed, none of them led to improvement of AD-linked cognitive decline and even sometimes they worsened them. In most of these trials, A\\u03b2 levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly decreased, thus clearly indicating that a reduction in total A\\u03b2 was not sufficient to restore cognitive function. This was the case for Semagacestat, the first GSI tested in late-stage clinical trials for AD, which was reported to reduce A\\u03b2 levels by more than 60% in the plasma (110), and new A\\u03b2 synthesis was decreased by more than 80% in CSF (111). More alarming, many trials were readily stopped because of increased risk of developing skin cancer and infections, which was supposed to be tightly linked to a defective Notch signaling in the presence of the inhibitors (112). Therefore, several groups started to screen for drugs having a higher affinity for APP than toward Notch, such as Avagacestat, initially reported to be 140-fold more selective for APP than Notch (113), although its Notch sparing ability remains controversial (114, 115). Avagacestat led to a 40% A\\u03b2 reduction in CSF (Table\\u00a01), but demonstrated similar side effects in clinical trials (116). Therefore, due to the huge number of different \\u03b3-secretase substrates, it has appeared difficult to target specifically and exclusively the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated APP cleavage. Furthermore, data from preclinical trials proposed that the lack of efficacy, or even worsening, of cognitive function in these trials was also linked to the progressive accumulation of APP-CTFs in the presence of GSIs (117). To avoid such effects, therapeutic development became focused on \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that were expected to be safer, since they interact with \\u03b3-secretase complex through the allosteric binding site, thereby modifying the enzyme activity but not blocking it (118). The concept of \\u03b3-secretase modulation was discovered with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, which are considered as GSMs, because they induce conformational changes in PS1 and shift the cleavage of C99 toward shorter A\\u03b2 species such as A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 (16, 119). In that way, GSMs do not lead to increased APP-CTFs levels. Indeed, in AD animal models, the chronic treatment with GSMs did not lead to the worsening of cognitive function observed with GSIs (117). Moreover, GSMs are also safer because they reduce the level of A\\u03b242 and increase shorter A\\u03b2 peptides without affecting Notch signaling (120, 121). Nonetheless, the first GSMs tested in clinical trials, Rofecoxib (122), Tarenflurbil (123) or Naproxen (124), did not show efficacy, but the lack of effects seemed to be related to a very poor blood\\u2013brain barrier crossing ability of these drugs (Table\\u00a01). Thus, taken together, \\u03b3-secretase-based strategies have so far been unsuccessful, even if GSMs seem to be more promising (125). Still, if considering \\u03b3\",\n",

Drugs can lead to increases in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate [9,89]. Drugs, just like increasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase, can affect the A\\u03b2 (x-42)/A\\u03b2 (x-40) ratio [11,13]. FAD mutations can affect how drugs bind to \\u03b3-secretase [7,10]. Drugs, FAD mutations, and the second substrate can affect the most dynamic parts in the presenilin structure that control processive catalysis (Supplementary Videos S3 and S4). The presented insights indicate that the first possible improvement in future drug development strategies could be the development of competitive inhibitors of \\u03b3-secretase [19]. These competitive inhibitors could mimic the effects of the protective A673T mutation, i.e., decreasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate [15,19]. Attempts to design competitive inhibitors that target the active site have been challenging. The attempts to target the active site with peptide analogs have been unsuccessful due to the surprisingly long and flexible active site tunnel [8,9,12,23]. Our results indicate three alternative strategies for the development of competitive inhibitors: First, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to facilitate the closure of the nicastrin ectodomain (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). Second, the competitive inhibitors could compete with the formation of \\u03b2-secretase\\u2013\\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 8). Third, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules and control its dimerization ([33,34,37] and Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 7). The development of compounds that target C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules is extremely difficult [39]. C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP has a highly dynamic structure and, thus, represents a poorly defined target for effective drug development efforts (Figure 1 and Figure 2 [33,34,37]). The prepared drugs have to compete with other molecules that bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP with high affinity ([37] and Figure 1C). The second major improvement in drug development strategies could be an expansion of the future target list. Compounds that can decrease the catalytic capacity of \\u03b3-secretase can be used to trace different physiological processes that control \\u03b3-secretase activity and amyloid metabolism at pre-symptomatic stages of the disease (Figure 9). Briefly, compounds such as semagacestat and avagacestat can be used in healthy animals to gradually induce pathogenesis, by provoking gradual saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate (Figure 9 [7,9]). The induced pathogenic events can be used for the description of physiological processes that control cellular\",\n",

These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Hur, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (Luo and Li, 2022).\n",

      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",
      "Clinical trials targeting gamma-secretase have faced challenges, as seen with the discontinuation of drugs like semagacestat and avagacestat due to off-target effects and cognitive decline in patients (Hur, 2022). However, ongoing research into the role of gamma-secretase in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction continues to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. The use of biomarkers, such as CSF Aβ levels, has also been investigated for their utility in assessing drug-target engagement in clinical settings (Luo and Li, 2022). Additionally, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity through selective inhibitors or modulators may provide a pathway for therapeutic intervention while minimizing side effects (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",

      "### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "Effective treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease may require a nuanced approach to modulating gamma-secretase activity. This includes the development of substrate-specific inhibitors that can reduce toxic Aβ production while preserving essential functions of the gamma-secretase complex (Hur, 2022). Additionally, exploring gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to correct presenilin mutations offers a promising avenue for future therapies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression (Luo and Li, 2022). The integration of findings linking Aβ42 levels and gamma-secretase inhibition into therapeutic strategies could provide new insights into managing AD effectively (Svedružić et al., 2023).\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Until so far, no mutations have been found in \\u03b2-secretase, but the Swedish and the Leuven APP mutations are known to shift the cleavage from the \\u03b2\\u2032-site to the \\u03b2-site, thus leading to a much higher C99 and A\\u03b2 production (12, 13, 37, 38). Inversely, the Icelandic mutation (A673T) seems to be protective against AD by decreasing \\u03b2-secretase cleavage and thus reducing by 40% the amyloidogenic fragments sAPP\\u03b2 and A\\u03b2 (17, 39). The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50). Further studies also revealed a very complex cleavage of APP-CTFs by \\u03b3-secretase, since it takes place within the membrane and successively at several sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6-, \\u03b3- and \\u03b3\\u2032). The first endopeptidase cleavage (\\u025b-cleavage) can occur at two distinct sites leading to the generation of A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249, which is then shortened by sequential carboxypeptidase cleavages (trimming) at \\u03b6, \\u03b3-and \\u03b3\\u2032-sites, occurring at each three or four residues and via two distinct product lines (A\\u03b249 > A\\u03b246 > A\\u03b243 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b237) or (A\\u03b248 > A\\u03b245 > A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b238) and the final occurrence of peptides of varying lengths but two major species of 40 or 42 amino acid residues, respectively (51).

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) is triggering the disease. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavages of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. The latter cleavage by \\u03b3-secretase, a unique and fascinating four-component protease complex, occurs in the APP transmembrane domain thereby releasing A\\u03b2 species of 37-43 amino acids in length including the longer, highly pathogenic peptides A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243. The lack of a precise understanding of A\\u03b2 generation as well as of the functions of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key AD drug target in the past few years. Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the \\u03b3-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes \\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP into different A\\u03b2 species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of A\\u03b242/43.

The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3.

The analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activity in human brain samples of PS1 FAD cases has shown that AICD formation is not affected whereas the carboxy-terminal processivity defects leading to increase A\\u03b242/40 ratios persist 117. These data strongly suggest that potential effects on the \\\"signaling cleavage\\\" are compensated by the remaining wt PS alleles. A recent study investigating a total of 138 PS1 FAD mutations could not find a correlation with increased A\\u03b242 ratios and the age of onset while the vast majority of the mutants showed strongly reduced total \\u03b3-secretase activity 135. This has been taken as another argument in favor of the presenilin hypothesis. However, the A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 levels and corresponding A\\u03b242/40 ratios of many PS1 FAD mutants that are well-characterized in cell-based assays were not recapitulated well in these assays and the pathogenic A\\u03b243 species had not been measured in the study. Moreover, predicting the age of onset of mutations from \\u03b3-secretase activities measured in cell-free in vitro assays using purified \\u03b3-secretase preparations in which loss of function effects are known to be more strongly pronounced 136 is problematic as this system differs dramatically from the heterozygous situation in FAD patient brain. Importantly, if loss of \\u03b3-secretase activity by presenilin mutations should be causative for AD, then haploinsufficiency of other \\u03b3-secretase subunits should also cause the disease. However, nonsense mutations that have been identified in PS1, NCT and PEN-2 are implicated in the cause of the rare skin disease acne inversa and not AD 137. Finally, it is obvious that all types of APP FAD mutations as well as the protective Icelandic mutation or the presence of AD in Down syndrome patients with an APP gene triplication are not explainable by the presenilin hypothesis. Taken together, balancing the available evidence, the support of the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains overwhelming, whereas the problems of the presenilin hypothesis persist. Since the amyloid cascade hypothesis predicts that lowering A\\u03b2 should be beneficial for AD, \\u03b3-secretase has been an obvious and major drug target. Thus, to inhibit its enzymatic activity and blocking A\\u03b2 generation, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were developed 138139. They fall into two principal classes, transition-state analogue (TSA) inhibitors, such as the prototypic L-685,458 140 and related compounds as well as non-TSA compounds. The former compounds, which target the catalytic site of \\u03b3-secretase were the first highly potent inhibitors identified. Non-TSA inhibitors such as DAPT 141 or LY450139 (semagacestat) 142 are considered to bind nearby the active site. Unfortunately, since such pan-GSIs inhibit both A\\u03b2 and Notch ICD (NICD) production, severe side effects were observed when administered in vivo, mainly due to disturbance of Notch signaling 143144145146. While this is unwanted for AD therapy, treatment of certain cancers may benefit from Notch pathway inhibition by GSIs 147. Several non-TSA GSIs were reported to have less inhibitory effects on NICD generation at a concentration range at which they sufficiently reduce A\\u03b2 secretion. Such Notch-sparing GSIs, as for example the promising candidate BMS-708163 (avagacestat) 148, were thus considered as improved\",\n",

Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (Luo and Li, 2022).

Cerebral neurodegeneration typically takes place first in the hippocampus, a region below the neocortex that is critical for consolidating long-term memories. Neuronal loss spreads to other cortical areas, leading to progressive cognitive decline. By the end stages of the disease, patients lose cognitive function to the point of requiring constant care, often institutionalized. Although a number of risk factors have been associated with AD, disease onset correlates best with age, and the large majority of cases occur in the elderly. Among people over age 85, over a third are afflicted. Two types of protein deposits are found in the AD brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2]. The former are extraneuronal and primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), whereas the latter are intraneuronal filaments of the normally microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuroinflammation is a third pathological feature of AD, in which microglia\\u2014phagocytic brain immune cells that release cytokines\\u2014become overactivated [3]. The role of each of these features in AD etiology and pathogenesis are not well understood. However, A\\u03b2 aggregation\\u2014in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques\\u2014is generally observed as the earliest pathology, followed by tau tangle formation and neurodegeneration [4]. For this reason and those mentioned in the next section, pathological A\\u03b2 is widely considered the initiator of AD, triggering downstream tau pathology and neuroinflammation, and A\\u03b2 has been the primary target for the development of AD therapeutics for over 25 years [5]. As mentioned above, the \\u201camyloid hypothesis\\u201d of AD pathogenesis has reigned for decades, and AD drug development has largely focused on inhibiting A\\u03b2\",\n",

Modifying any of the heterocycles on E2012 could improve binding affinity and/or selectivity for imidazole-like GSMs. GSMs bind to multiple allosteric sites on \\u03b3-secretase, which in turn may alter conformation of the active site (Fig.\\u00a09B) [85]. While these structural studies will need to be supported by experimental data, they can be applied towards rational design of the next generation GSIs and GSMs for AD therapeutics. While targeting \\u03b3-secretase has proven challenging, it should not diminish its potential as a crucial target for AD pathogenesis. The serious toxicities that halted clinical studies of GSIs demonstrated there were many knowledge gaps about \\u03b3-secretase biology and underestimation of its nuanced proteolysis before the compounds were evaluated in humans [49]. GSMs aim to stimulate \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s carboxypeptidase-like trimming of A\\u03b2 peptides to their shorter, less pathogenic forms. Over the past two decades, industry and academic groups have optimized the potency and CNS penetration of GSMs, several of which have started clinical trials. The success of small molecule GSMs, as with other A\\u03b2-targeted therapies, also depend on being administered in the early stages of AD pathology well before clinical manifestations. Amyloid-based biomarkers and diagnostics will be vital to identifying and monitoring trial subjects. The development of the first GSM-based radiotracer suggests that that \\u03b3-secretase expression could be monitored in AD patients. In the past several years, detailed structures of \\u03b3-secretase have emerged. These structures have already been used in computational docking studies for GSMs [91]. Modeling GSMs with varying chemotypes could be insightful for comparing their mechanisms of recognizing and altering substrate and enzyme transmembrane domains. The latest \\u03b3-secretase structures bound to GSIs and E2012 offer a wealth of information for the design and lead optimization of more potent and substrate-selective small molecules. Drug combinations using drugs which act on distinct targets or show different mechanisms of action have been commonly been used in cancer [92]. A few combination therapies could involve (1) distinct structural classes of GSMs (2) GSMs and inhibitors of tau in neurofibrillary tangles, and (3) GSMs and agents which stimulate A\\u03b2 clearance.

Single and long-term daily dosing studies demonstrated dose-dependent increases in CSF A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 and corresponding decreases in CSF A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 without changes in total A\\u03b2. However, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, indicating liver toxicity, were also observed, and further development of BMS-932,481 was discontinued [72]. In the previous year, one of the oxidative products of BMS-932,481 was identified as the primary metabolite found in rat and human liver microsomes [73]. The authors hypothesized that the conversion of BMS-932,481 to this metabolite, in which an alcohol was substituted at the C-5 position, led to the formation of reactive species which could result in liver injury. Development of GSM derivatives from this group focused on blocking the metabolism at the C-5 position have yet to be reported. A collaboration between the University of California San Diego and Massachusetts General Hospital synthesized and characterized a series of pyridazine-derived GSM analogs [74]. The top candidate UCSD-776,890 reduced A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 in a dose-dependent manner across acute, subchronic, and chronic dosing studies in multiple species. In prophylactic and disease-modifying regimens administered to 3 and 6\\u00a0month AD transgenic mice respectively, UCSD-776,890 reduced plasma and brain A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 as well as amyloid deposition and microgliosis. Additionally, based on comparison of systemic exposure the compound at 50% effective equivalent human dose is expected to have over a 130-fold safety margin. These studies demonstrate the possibility for small molecule GSMs to be safely administered as secondary prevention in genetically predisposed subjects, or at-risk subjects who are amyloid-positive based on PET imaging. UCSD-776,890 is currently being prepared for phase I studies. The ability to image amyloid and CSF biomarkers in human subjects has been crucial to monitoring the progress of clinical trials in AD [75]. A PET radiotracer based on pyridazine-derived GSM BPN-15606 demonstrated good brain uptake and selectivity for imaging PS1/ \\u03b3-secretase in brains of AD transgenic mice [76]. Elevated brain uptake in AD mice was observed in several critical regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, and mid-brain compared to wild-type mice. Interestingly, imaging studies in the brains of rodents and nonhuman primates revealed overlapping areas of higher uptake, pointing to conservation of \\u03b3-secretase activity. The GSM-based probe is a valuable molecular imaging tool which can be applied to further investigate physiological \\u03b3-secretase structure\\u2013function and potentially optimized as a radiotracer in AD patients. For many years, structural and functional insights of \\u03b3-secretase came from chemical probes derived from GSIs and GSMs [57, 77]. Photoaffinity labeling (PAL) has been a valuable tool for target identification of small molecules [78]. Photoaffinity probes, or photoprobes, contain a photoreactive group which crosslinks to binding targets upon UV irradiation and a reporter tag which enables purification or monitoring of the target.

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4].

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

While \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) target A\\u03b2 peptide production, they carry significant side effects due to their impact on normal \\u03b3-secretase functions, making it difficult to establish a therapeutic window.

Unfortunately, little was learned from the failed trials\\u00a0(De Strooper, 2014), and \\u03b3-secretases were largely deprioritized as drug targets for the industry in the context of AD. Interestingly, the capacity of GSIs to block Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999) remained all this time of interest to companies in the context of cancer and chronic inflammation (McCaw et al, 2021; Christopoulos et al, 2021). Nirogacestat (Ogsiveo) recently became the first GSI to reach regulatory approval for rare desmoid tumors that are non-cancerous growths of the connective tissue (Gounder et al, 2023) (see Box\\u00a01). Recent success with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) in AD have considerably changed the perspective on the potential of A\\u03b2 lowering as a possible therapy for this devastating disorder (Karran et al, 2011; Karran and De Strooper, 2022). However, various aspects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy may not make them the optimal therapeutic choice for primary prevention clinical studies. A possible approach to primary prevention might be the suppression of A\\u03b2 production so that the key A\\u03b2 plaque-seeding peptides are not produced in sufficient concentrations to initiate plaque formation. While inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase or of BACE1, the other protease that is needed to release A\\u03b2 from APP (Fig.\\u00a01), remain formal possibilities, both approaches suffer from the same dilemma: can a therapeutic window be established sparing the normal functions of both enzymes? To administer agents that already carry known adverse events to normal individuals lacks clinical equipoise. Gamma-secretase allosteric stabilizers (GSAS), in contrast to \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), theoretically allow normal physiological processing of the many substrates of the \\u03b3-secretases, while enhancing the processive cleavage of the A\\u03b2 peptide, favouring the generation of shorter forms as we will discuss below. The GSASs avoid the mechanism-based side effects that precluded the clinical development of GSIs and revert the production of all long A\\u03b2 peptides to shorter forms, in contrast to the earlier \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSM) that were directed to A\\u03b242 lowering (Weggen et al, 2001; Luo and Li, 2022). In the first part of this review, we will discuss our current understanding of \\u03b3-secretases and the effect of clinical mutations on their activity, resolving ongoing controversy in the field. We will stress how novel insights from cryo-EM structures (Yang et al, 2021) and a better understanding of function\\u00a0(Petit et al, 2022a; Szaruga et al, 2017) and cell biology (Sannerud et al, 2016) of the \\u03b3-secretases have allowed insights into the mode of action of GSASs. In the second part of the review, we will use these insights to explain the mode of action of GSASs and to discuss the roadblocks to further clinical development of GSAS-based precision medicine approaches for the prevention of AD. One of the major aims of the therapeutic development of GSIs in AD was to separate Notch from APP processing. The putative Notch sparing inhibitor avagacestat (Coric et al, 2015) made it to a phase-II clinical trial but was halted because of Notch and other side effects. Recent cryo-EM structures show that semagacestat and avagacestat bind close to\",\n",

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Hur, 2022). Recent research emphasizes that pathological elevations in Aβ42 can inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to dysregulation of cellular signaling and contributing to neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Hur, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Hur, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Hur, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Hur, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",

In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4).

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242. The compound BMS-932,481 (Soares et al, 2016) had the desired effects on A\\u03b2: decreased A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, and increased A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 without effecting total A\\u03b2 in humans. However, liver toxicity limited the dose, and further clinical development has stopped. From the published work, compound PF-06648671 (Ahn et al, 2020) appears promising. Three phase-I clinical trials involving in total of 120 patients exposed to single and multiple-ascending doses have been reported (Ahn et al, 2020).

We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced. We propose the term \\u201c\\u03b3-secretase allosteric stabilizers\\u201d (GSAS) to distinguish these compounds from the rather heterogenous class of GSM. The GSAS represent, in theory, a precision medicine approach to the prevention of amyloid deposition, as they specifically target a discrete aspect in a complex cell biological signalling mechanism that initiates the pathological processes leading to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed.

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Hur, 2022). Recent research emphasizes that pathological elevations in Aβ42 can inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to dysregulation of cellular signaling and contributing to neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Hur, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Hur, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Hur, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Hur, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) is triggering the disease. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavages of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. The latter cleavage by \\u03b3-secretase, a unique and fascinating four-component protease complex, occurs in the APP transmembrane domain thereby releasing A\\u03b2 species of 37-43 amino acids in length including the longer, highly pathogenic peptides A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243. The lack of a precise understanding of A\\u03b2 generation as well as of the functions of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key AD drug target in the past few years. Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the \\u03b3-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes \\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP into different A\\u03b2 species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of A\\u03b242/43. Finally, we discuss how the knowledge emerging from these studies could be used to therapeutically target this enzyme in a safe way.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u00b4s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide currently affecting about 47 millions people. The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3. A\\u03b2 is a small hydrophobic ~4 kDa peptide, which is derived by sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a single pass transmembrane protein with type I topology which is expressed in neurons\",\n",

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

The analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activity in human brain samples of PS1 FAD cases has shown that AICD formation is not affected whereas the carboxy-terminal processivity defects leading to increase A\\u03b242/40 ratios persist 117. These data strongly suggest that potential effects on the \\\"signaling cleavage\\\" are compensated by the remaining wt PS alleles. A recent study investigating a total of 138 PS1 FAD mutations could not find a correlation with increased A\\u03b242 ratios and the age of onset while the vast majority of the mutants showed strongly reduced total \\u03b3-secretase activity 135. This has been taken as another argument in favor of the presenilin hypothesis. However, the A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 levels and corresponding A\\u03b242/40 ratios of many PS1 FAD mutants that are well-characterized in cell-based assays were not recapitulated well in these assays and the pathogenic A\\u03b243 species had not been measured in the study. Moreover, predicting the age of onset of mutations from \\u03b3-secretase activities measured in cell-free in vitro assays using purified \\u03b3-secretase preparations in which loss of function effects are known to be more strongly pronounced 136 is problematic as this system differs dramatically from the heterozygous situation in FAD patient brain. Importantly, if loss of \\u03b3-secretase activity by presenilin mutations should be causative for AD, then haploinsufficiency of other \\u03b3-secretase subunits should also cause the disease. However, nonsense mutations that have been identified in PS1, NCT and PEN-2 are implicated in the cause of the rare skin disease acne inversa and not AD 137. Finally, it is obvious that all types of APP FAD mutations as well as the protective Icelandic mutation or the presence of AD in Down syndrome patients with an APP gene triplication are not explainable by the presenilin hypothesis. Taken together, balancing the available evidence, the support of the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains overwhelming, whereas the problems of the presenilin hypothesis persist. Since the amyloid cascade hypothesis predicts that lowering A\\u03b2 should be beneficial for AD, \\u03b3-secretase has been an obvious and major drug target. Thus, to inhibit its enzymatic activity and blocking A\\u03b2 generation, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were developed 138139. They fall into two principal classes, transition-state analogue (TSA) inhibitors, such as the prototypic L-685,458 140 and related compounds as well as non-TSA compounds. The former compounds, which target the catalytic site of \\u03b3-secretase were the first highly potent inhibitors identified. Non-TSA inhibitors such as DAPT 141 or LY450139 (semagacestat) 142 are considered to bind nearby the active site. Unfortunately, since such pan-GSIs inhibit both A\\u03b2 and Notch ICD (NICD) production, severe side effects were observed when administered in vivo, mainly due to disturbance of Notch signaling 143144145146. While this is unwanted for AD therapy, treatment of certain cancers may benefit from Notch pathway inhibition by GSIs 147. Several non-TSA GSIs were reported to have less inhibitory effects on NICD generation at a concentration range at which they sufficiently reduce A\\u03b2 secretion. Such Notch-sparing GSIs, as for example the promising candidate BMS-708163 (avagacestat) 148, were thus considered as improved\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy.

We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020).

A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.

      "        \"original_text\": \"pathological A\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2 11-x) (36). Until so far, no mutations have been found in \\u03b2-secretase, but the Swedish and the Leuven APP mutations are known to shift the cleavage from the \\u03b2\\u2032-site to the \\u03b2-site, thus leading to a much higher C99 and A\\u03b2 production (12, 13, 37, 38). Inversely, the Icelandic mutation (A673T) seems to be protective against AD by decreasing \\u03b2-secretase cleavage and thus reducing by 40% the amyloidogenic fragments sAPP\\u03b2 and A\\u03b2 (17, 39). The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50). Further studies also revealed a very complex cleavage of APP-CTFs by \\u03b3-secretase, since it takes place within the membrane and successively at several sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6-, \\u03b3- and \\u03b3\\u2032). The first endopeptidase cleavage (\\u025b-cleavage) can occur at two distinct sites leading to the generation of A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249, which is then shortened by sequential carboxypeptidase cleavages (trimming) at \\u03b6, \\u03b3-and \\u03b3\\u2032-sites, occurring at each three or four residues and via two distinct product lines (A\\u03b249 > A\\u03b246 > A\\u03b243 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b237) or (A\\u03b248 > A\\u03b245 > A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b238) and the final occurrence of peptides of varying lengths but two major species of 40 or 42 amino acid residues, respectively (51). Whereas A\\u03b240 is the most abundant peptide, A\\u03b242 is considered as the most pathogenic due to its high aggregation propensity.Figure\\u00a02\\u03b3-secretase.A, displays a schematic representation of presenilins (PS1 or PS2) composed of nine transmembrane domains and harboring the catalytic core of the complex with two aspartyl residues in the transmembrane domains TM-6 and TM-7.

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Hur, 2022). Recent research emphasizes that pathological elevations in Aβ42 can inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to dysregulation of cellular signaling and contributing to neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Hur, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Hur, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Hur, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Hur, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",

Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a), but kinetic modeling combined with informative site-directed mutagenesis will be important to fully unravel the function of these remarkable structures (Bhattarai et al, 2022; Chen et al, 2023; Petit et al, 2022b).

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) is triggering the disease. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavages of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. The latter cleavage by \\u03b3-secretase, a unique and fascinating four-component protease complex, occurs in the APP transmembrane domain thereby releasing A\\u03b2 species of 37-43 amino acids in length including the longer, highly pathogenic peptides A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243. The lack of a precise understanding of A\\u03b2 generation as well as of the functions of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key AD drug target in the past few years. Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the \\u03b3-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes \\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP into different A\\u03b2 species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of A\\u03b242/43. Finally, we discuss how the knowledge emerging from these studies could be used to therapeutically target this enzyme in a safe way.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u00b4s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide currently affecting about 47 millions people. The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3. A\\u03b2 is a small hydrophobic ~4 kDa peptide, which is derived by sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a single pass transmembrane protein with type I topology which is expressed in neurons\",\n",

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex crucial for the cleavage of type I transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase results in the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the production of neurotoxic Aβ, particularly the longer forms like Aβ42, significantly contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The aggregation of Aβ peptides is considered a key initiating event in the development of AD pathology (Hur, 2022). Recent research emphasizes that pathological elevations in Aβ42 can inhibit gamma-secretase activity, leading to dysregulation of cellular signaling and contributing to neurotoxicity (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alterations in Target Expression in Human Disease\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma-secretase are altered due to mutations in presenilin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex. These mutations disrupt normal gamma-secretase function, leading to an imbalance in Aβ production, which contributes to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss (Hur, 2022). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in presenilin are linked to approximately 90% of familial AD cases, indicating a strong association between target expression and AD pathology (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs and altered Aβ levels at synapses have been correlated with gamma-secretase inhibition, highlighting the importance of this target in AD progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Target Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to the Disease\n",
      "Gamma-secretase is involved in several physiological processes beyond Aβ production, including Notch signaling and calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes, due to altered gamma-secretase activity, can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, which are critical features of AD progression (Hur, 2022). Furthermore, presenilin mutations have been shown to affect calcium signaling mechanisms, contributing to excitotoxicity and further neuronal damage (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The cyclic inhibitory mechanism of Aβ42 on gamma-secretase may also lead to changes in signaling pathways that are vital for cognitive functions, further linking this target to the disease's pathophysiology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\n",
      "Various phenotypes related to presenilin mutations, such as early-onset familial AD, have been identified. Genetic variations in presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are linked to increased Aβ production and aggregation, leading to cognitive decline and memory deficits in affected individuals (Hur, 2022). The discovery of novel susceptibility loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has also highlighted the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Genetic Link Between the Target and the Disease\n",
      "The genetic link between gamma-secretase and Alzheimer’s disease is well-established, particularly through the identification of over 200 mutations in presenilin genes associated with familial AD. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of APP, resulting in elevated levels of toxic Aβ species (Hur, 2022). The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to amyloid processing, such as APOE, further underscores the genetic interplay involved in AD risk (De Strooper and Karran, 2024).\n",

      "### Clinical Evidence and Tools Acting on the Pathway\n",

However, ongoing research into the role of gamma-secretase in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction continues to provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies. The use of biomarkers, such as CSF Aβ levels, has also been investigated for their utility in assessing drug-target engagement in clinical settings (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). Additionally, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity through selective inhibitors or modulators may provide a pathway for therapeutic intervention while minimizing side effects (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Required Target Modulation for Disease Treatment\n",
      "Effective treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s disease may require a nuanced approach to modulating gamma-secretase activity. This includes the development of substrate-specific inhibitors that can reduce toxic Aβ production while preserving essential functions of the gamma-secretase complex (Hur, 2022). Additionally, exploring gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to correct presenilin mutations offers a promising avenue for future therapies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression (De Strooper and Karran, 2024). The integration of findings linking Aβ42 levels and gamma-secretase inhibition into therapeutic strategies could provide new insights into managing AD effectively (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

    "The working hypothesis posits that targeting gamma secretase (GSEC) can effectively modulate the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By selectively inhibiting GSEC activity, it may be possible to reduce the accumulation of neurotoxic Aβ aggregates, thus mitigating the progression of AD. This approach is grounded in the understanding that GSEC is responsible for the final cleavage of APP, leading to the generation of Aβ peptides of varying lengths, with Aβ42 being particularly pathogenic.\n",

There is a critical unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that can halt or slow the neurodegenerative process. Targeting GSEC represents a novel strategy to directly influence the production of Aβ, thus addressing a key pathological feature of AD.\n",

    "### Working Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex is crucial in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its role in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to produce amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, notably Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are integral to the formation of amyloid plaques, a defining characteristic of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to initiate neurotoxic cascades that lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This underscores the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, with the goal of modulating its activity to decrease the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unmet medical need in AD treatment arises from the failure of previous therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ, particularly gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which caused severe side effects due to the inhibition of Notch signaling and other essential pathways. This highlights the necessity for more selective approaches, such as gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) or allosteric stabilizers, which could alter Aβ processing without compromising GSEC's other physiological functions. The failure of GSIs has prompted a shift towards understanding the complex biology of GSEC and its substrates to develop safer and more effective therapeutics.\n",
    "\n",
    "GSEC represents a suitable candidate for combination therapy, particularly when paired with other approaches targeting different aspects of AD pathology, such as tau aggregation or neuroinflammation. By modulating GSEC activity in conjunction with other therapeutic modalities, it may be possible to achieve a more comprehensive treatment strategy that addresses multiple facets of AD progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40, have been shown to correlate with disease progression and can serve as valuable indicators for therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials. Existing biomarkers, including amyloid PET imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, provide critical insights into the amyloid burden in patients and can facilitate patient stratification for clinical studies. The identification of patients with elevated levels of Aβ42 or those exhibiting specific genetic mutations linked to familial AD can enhance the precision of therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC and its role in Aβ production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, no cure exists for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. With the aging population, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC offers a promising opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43 is especially linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), highlighting the critical need for effective GSEC modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For example, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly considering the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology. The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by studies indicating that GSEC inhibition can lead to altered Aβ peptide profiles without exacerbating the production of toxic fragments like C99.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio indicates the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition. Neurofilament light protein is also emerging as a biomarker of neurodegeneration, reflecting its translational value in both animal models and clinical settings. These biomarkers can guide clinical decision-making and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing biomarkers, including neuroimaging techniques (such as PET scans detecting amyloid deposition) and CSF analysis for Aβ peptides, hold significant clinical relevance. They assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and help identify patients who may benefit from GSEC-targeted therapies. The use of these biomarkers in clinical trials can also aid in stratifying patients based on their likelihood of responding to GSEC modulators, thereby optimizing trial outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches in AD treatment. The correlation between CSF Aβ levels and brain deposition further emphasizes the role of these biomarkers in understanding GSEC activity and its implications for AD.\n",

    "- **Amyloid PET imaging:** Decreased amyloid plaque burden on positron emission tomography (PET) scans could serve as a marker of treatment response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio:** Changes in the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 in the blood could reflect alterations in amyloid processing and serve as a non-invasive biomarker.\n",

Considering the unmet medical need for disease-modifying treatments, the suitability for combination therapy, and the availability of predictive and clinically relevant biomarkers, gamma secretase inhibitors have the potential to significantly impact the management of AD.\n",

Aβ42 peptides, produced via the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, can inhibit γ-secretase activity itself, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). This self-inhibiting mechanism implicates Aβ42 as a crucial factor in neuroinflammatory processes and neuronal dysfunction associated with AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need in AD treatment is substantial, as current therapies primarily target symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. There is a pressing requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity to reduce Aβ42 production without compromising its essential functions, such as the processing of other substrates involved in neuronal signaling (Hur, 2022). Increased levels of Aβ42 may induce feedback inhibition on γ-secretase, leading to neuronal death through mechanisms involving p75 neurotrophin receptor activation, suggesting potential intervention pathways to mitigate these effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifaceted role of γ-secretase in AD, combination therapies, including γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) alongside traditional treatments, may offer a synergistic approach. GSMs can selectively alter the cleavage of APP toward shorter, non-toxic Aβ species while preserving the cleavage of other vital substrates like Notch, thus minimizing adverse effects associated with γ-secretase inhibition (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for assessing the efficacy of γ-secretase modulation may include levels of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as specific APP-CTFs. Elevated Aβ42 levels and the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 correlate with cognitive decline and amyloid plaque formation, making them suitable candidates for monitoring disease progression and treatment response (Hur, 2022). The concentration of Aβ42 in synaptosomes from end-stage AD brains can reach roughly 10 nM, a level known to inhibit γ-secretase function, further supporting the relevance of Aβ42 as a biomarker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical relevance is underscored by biomarkers such as Aβ42 and total tau levels, widely used for diagnosing and monitoring AD. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain, particularly in amyloid plaque form, is a hallmark of AD pathology, while tau pathology correlates with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. These biomarkers not only aid in diagnosis but also provide insights into the effectiveness of emerging therapies targeting γ-secretase (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, targeting γ-secretase represents a compelling therapeutic avenue in AD, with potential for innovative strategies that address both the production of toxic Aβ species and the preservation of essential signaling functions within the brain. The cyclic inhibition of γ-secretase by Aβ42 indicates that managing Aβ levels could be vital in preventing a detrimental feedback loop that exacerbates neurodegeneration (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complexity of AD pathogenesis, combination therapies targeting both Aβ production and tau pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For example, using GSMs alongside agents that promote Aβ clearance could address both the production and accumulation of toxic Aβ species, potentially resulting in improved clinical outcomes. The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition of γ-secretase activity suggests that therapies should aim to stabilize Aβ levels to restore normal signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for monitoring treatment response in AD include levels of Aβ42 and tau proteins in CSF. The Aβ42/p-tau ratio has been identified as a robust biomarker for distinguishing AD from other dementias, emphasizing its utility in clinical settings for diagnosis and tracking disease progression. Furthermore, understanding the dynamics of Aβ production and clearance in relation to γ-secretase activity may provide insights into patient-specific therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clinical relevance of existing biomarkers is highlighted by the utility of core CSF biomarkers such as total tau and phosphorylated tau in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in its early stages. The integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice is essential for improving diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease management. Existing biomarkers, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in CSF, have been shown to correlate with amyloid plaque burden and cognitive decline in AD patients (Liu et al., 2022). These biomarkers not only aid in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's but also serve as endpoints in clinical trials evaluating GSEC inhibitors, providing insights into the pharmacodynamics of GSEC inhibition and its potential impact on disease progression.\n"

Aβ42 peptides, produced via the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, can inhibit γ-secretase activity itself, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). This self-inhibiting mechanism implicates Aβ42 as a crucial factor in neuroinflammatory processes and neuronal dysfunction associated with AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
    "\n",
    "The unmet medical need in AD treatment is substantial, as current therapies primarily target symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. There is a pressing requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity to reduce Aβ42 production without compromising its essential functions, such as the processing of other substrates involved in neuronal signaling (Hur, 2022). Increased levels of Aβ42 may induce feedback inhibition on γ-secretase, leading to neuronal death through mechanisms involving p75 neurotrophin receptor activation, suggesting potential intervention pathways to mitigate these effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the multifaceted role of γ-secretase in AD, combination therapies, including γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) alongside traditional treatments, may offer a synergistic approach. GSMs can selectively alter the cleavage of APP toward shorter, non-toxic Aβ species while preserving the cleavage of other vital substrates like Notch, thus minimizing adverse effects associated with γ-secretase inhibition (Hur, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive biomarkers for assessing the efficacy of γ-secretase modulation may include levels of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as specific APP-CTFs. Elevated Aβ42 levels and the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 correlate with cognitive decline and amyloid plaque formation, making them suitable candidates for monitoring disease progression and treatment response (Hur, 2022). The concentration of Aβ42 in synaptosomes from end-stage AD brains can reach roughly 10 nM, a level known to inhibit γ-secretase function, further supporting the relevance of Aβ42 as a biomarker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical relevance is underscored by biomarkers such as Aβ42 and total tau levels, widely used for diagnosing and monitoring AD. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain, particularly in amyloid plaque form, is a hallmark of AD pathology, while tau pathology correlates with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. These biomarkers not only aid in diagnosis but also provide insights into the effectiveness of emerging therapies targeting γ-secretase (Hur, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, targeting γ-secretase represents a compelling therapeutic avenue in AD, with potential for innovative strategies that address both the production of toxic Aβ species and the preservation of essential signaling functions within the brain. The cyclic inhibition of γ-secretase by Aβ42 indicates that managing Aβ levels could be vital in preventing a detrimental feedback loop that exacerbates neurodegeneration (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the complexity of AD pathogenesis, combination therapies targeting both Aβ production and tau pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For example, using GSMs alongside agents that promote Aβ clearance could address both the production and accumulation of toxic Aβ species, potentially resulting in improved clinical outcomes. The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition of γ-secretase activity suggests that therapies should aim to stabilize Aβ levels to restore normal signaling pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive biomarkers for monitoring treatment response in AD include levels of Aβ42 and tau proteins in CSF. The Aβ42/p-tau ratio has been identified as a robust biomarker for distinguishing AD from other dementias, emphasizing its utility in clinical settings for diagnosis and tracking disease progression. Furthermore, understanding the dynamics of Aβ production and clearance in relation to γ-secretase activity may provide insights into patient-specific therapeutic strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clinical relevance of existing biomarkers is highlighted by the utility of core CSF biomarkers such as total tau and phosphorylated tau in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in its early stages. The integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice is essential for improving diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease management. Existing biomarkers, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in CSF, have been shown to correlate with amyloid plaque burden and cognitive decline in AD patients (Liu et al., 2022). These biomarkers not only aid in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's but also serve as endpoints in clinical trials evaluating GSEC inhibitors, providing insights into the pharmacodynamics of GSEC inhibition and its potential impact on disease progression."
