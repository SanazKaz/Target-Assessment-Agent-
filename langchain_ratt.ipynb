    "# Scientific Rationale for Gamma Secretase in Alzheimer's Disease\n",
    "\n",

    "## Target Information \n",
    "### Develop a scientific rationale for the following:\n",
    "                             \n",
    "    **Given target:** Gamma secretase\n",
    "    **Given disease:** Alzheimer's disease\n",
    "    **Given mode of action:** Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Context:\n",
    "Aβ is a family of secreted peptides generated from the sequential cleavages of the type 1 membrane protein APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and gamma-secretase (GSEC), respectively. \n",
    "BACE cleaves APP in the luminal domain, releasing the N-terminal soluble APPβ domain and leaving the C-terminal fragment, APP-CTF, which remains in the membrane. \n",
    "Subsequently, the APP-CTF is recruited to GSEC, a complex comprising four subunits, including PS, which harbors the active site. GSEC first cuts APP-CTF at the epsilon-cleavage site located close to the inner leaflet of the membrane. \n",
    "This cleavage event produces either Aβ48 or Aβ49 and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The membrane-retained Aβ48 or Aβ49 is then further processed by GSEC in a continuous cascade of proteolytical events at every third of fourth amino acid, where the N-terminal product of each reaction becomes the substrate for the next GSEC cleavage event.\n",
    "Accordingly, GSEC processes APP-CTF along two main product lines, Aβ49 → 46 → 43 → 40 → 37… and Aβ48 → 45 → 42 → 38…, respectively (Takami et al., 2009; Matsumura et al., 2014; Olsson et al., 2014). During this processing cascade, Aβ43 and shorter Aβ peptides stochastically escape further processing by GSEC and are released into the extracellular space. \n",
    "As a result, Aβ peptides varying from 30 to 43 amino acids in length are secreted into the extracellular space. Among all secreted Aβ, Aβ40 is the most abundant in human CSF, followed by Aβ38, Aβ42, and Aβ37 (Liu et al., 2022). In cognitively normal individuals, Aβ42 and Aβ43 represent a smaller portion of the total secreted Aβ (Liu et al., 2022).\n",
    "These longer forms of Aβ seed the formation of Aβ-amyloid aggregates, a key step in the formation of amyloid plaques (Veugelen et al., 2016), as illustrated in Figure 1. Aβ42, which is produced in higher amounts than Aβ43, is the most abundant Aβ in amyloid plaques (Welander et al., 2009).\n",

      "####################draft 0: ## Scientific Rationale for Gamma Secretase in Alzheimer's Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase inhibition can reduce the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is implicated in the formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). By targeting gamma secretase, it is possible to decrease the aggregation and deposition of Aβ42, potentially slowing the progression of AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Detailed Description of the Idea\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase is a key enzyme in the production of Aβ peptides from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The enzyme cleaves APP to produce various Aβ peptides, including Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and is a major component of amyloid plaques found in AD patients. Inhibiting gamma secretase could reduce the levels of Aβ42, thereby decreasing plaque formation and neurotoxicity associated with AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure and limited treatment options that mainly address symptoms rather than the underlying pathology. Current therapies do not effectively halt or reverse disease progression. There is a significant need for disease-modifying treatments that target the root causes of AD, such as amyloid plaque formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase inhibitors could be used in combination with other therapeutic strategies targeting different aspects of AD pathology, such as tau protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Combining therapies could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing the disease and improving patient outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for the efficacy of gamma secretase inhibitors could include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **CSF Aβ42 levels:** Reduced levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could indicate effective inhibition of gamma secretase.\n",
      "- **Amyloid PET imaging:** Decreased amyloid plaque burden on positron emission tomography (PET) scans could serve as a marker of treatment response.\n",
      "- **Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio:** Changes in the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 in the blood could reflect alterations in amyloid processing and serve as a non-invasive biomarker.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers for AD, such as CSF Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau levels, as well as amyloid PET imaging, are clinically relevant for diagnosing AD and assessing disease progression. These biomarkers can also be utilized to monitor the therapeutic effects of gamma secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, providing valuable information on their efficacy and mechanism of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, targeting gamma secretase to reduce Aβ42 production represents a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Given the unmet medical need for disease-modifying treatments, the suitability for combination therapy, and the availability of predictive and clinically relevant biomarkers, gamma secretase inhibitors have the potential to significantly impact the management of AD.########################################\n",

A\\u03b242 inhibits \\u03b3-secretases, causing the accumulation of unprocessed substrates like C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and p75, leading to impaired downstream signaling and neuronal death. The study highlights how elevated A\\u03b242 levels might contribute to AD pathogenesis through this feedback inhibition mechanism on \\u03b3-secretase, suggesting a critical link between A\\u03b242 and the disruption of cellular homeostasis associated with AD.\\n\\n9\": {\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular -homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) (1). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (5, 6), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatment with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (7), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (8\\u201312). The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing\",\n",

In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020).

It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

It illustrates the amyloidogenic pathway, where \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) cleaves APP to release a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF), subsequently processed by \\u03b3-secretase to yield amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides. Specifically, the length of A\\u03b2 peptides, which ranges from 37 to 43 amino acids, impacts their aggregation and neurotoxic properties, central to AD pathology. Mutations promoting amyloidogenic processing correlate with AD, whereas those favoring the non-amyloidogenic pathway are protective. \\n\\n7\": {\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019). (A) The scheme depicts the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) and p3 peptides.

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92.

Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

Effects of FAD mutations on each proteolytic step are unknown, largely due to difficulties in detecting and quantifying longer A\\u03b2 peptides. To address this, we carried out systematic and quantitative analyses of all tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts from proteolysis of wild-type and 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by purified \\u03b3-secretase. These small peptides, including FAD-mutant forms, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by establishing concentration curves for each of 32 standards. APP intracellular domain (AICD) coproducts were quantified by immunoblot, and the ratio of AICD products corresponding to A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 was determined by mass spectrometry. Levels of individual A\\u03b2 peptides were determined by subtracting levels of peptide coproducts associated with degradation from those associated with production. This method was validated for A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 by specific ELISAs and production of equimolar levels of A\\u03b2 and AICD. Not all mutant substrates led to increased A\\u03b242/40.

       "</span><span class=\"diff-line diff-add\">+The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42 and Aβ43, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",

As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations.\n",

      "## Scientific Rationale for Gamma Secretase in Alzheimer's Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42 and Aβ43, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition.

To quantify \\u03b3-secretase processivity, Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez\\u2019s lab has introduced a ratio between the sum of the products of the fourth catalytic turnover divided by the sum of the products of the third catalytic step, which are the substrates of the fourth catalytic turnover (9). Ultimately, this ratio provides an overall measure of \\u03b3-secretase processivity along both product lines. Applying this method to an in\\u00a0vitro analysis of A\\u03b2 profiles of 25 FAD-linked PSEN1 mutants, the authors found a linear correlation between mutation-driven alterations in A\\u03b2 profiles and age at onset of AD in humans (9). Hence, to assess \\u03b3-secretase processivity in our nine rat lines, we calculated the A\\u03b2 (38\\u2009+\\u200940)/(42\\u2009+\\u200943) ratios. We observed a gene-dosage\\u2013dependent reduction of \\u03b3-secretase processivity caused by the Psen1LF mutation; in contrast, the Swedish mutation did not significantly change \\u03b3-secretase processivity, regardless of the Psen1 genotype (Fig.\\u00a09, A and B). Overall, the data indicate that co-expression of the Psen1LF and the Swedish mutations cause both synergistic and opposite effects on A\\u03b2 brain composition in a gene-dosage\\u2013dependent manner: A\\u03b243 production is synergistically increased by the two FAD mutations, while the Psen1LF mutation obliterates A\\u03b238 production, which is increased by the Swedish mutation. To test whether these rat knock-in models can inform about disease mechanisms driving amyloid pathology in sporadic LOAD cases, we analyzed amyloid plaques composition in MCI and LOAD cases (Table\\u00a03). Consecutive slices from three MCI and one LOAD cases were stained, with the same antibodies used for rat IHC, in the following order A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b243 > pan-A\\u03b2 (Fig.\\u00a010A).

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4).

Recently, A\\u03b243 generation and deposition were found to be increased in the brains of those carrying FAD mutations in PS1 [13, 14]. These studies raise the possibility that A\\u03b243 plays a pivotal role in the development of FAD. \\u03b3-Secretase generates each A\\u03b2 under two pathways. At first, A\\u03b249 and A\\u03b248 are cleaved from APP. A\\u03b249 is successively cleaved, mostly to A\\u03b240, via A\\u03b246 and A\\u03b243, while A\\u03b248 is similarly cleaved to A\\u03b238 via A\\u03b245 and A\\u03b242. Of note, the most abundant species, A\\u03b240, is derived not from A\\u03b242 but from A\\u03b243. Moreover, A\\u03b238 is derived mainly from A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 [18\\u201320]. These sequential A\\u03b2 generation mechanisms have been referred to as stepwise processing [18\\u201320]. We previously reported that (i) the levels of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 are proportional, and the levels of A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b240 are also proportional in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sporadic AD participants, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, and cognitively normal controls (NCs). The levels of A\\u03b2 concentration in the CSF might reflect lipid raft-associated \\u03b3-secretase activity from brain cortices [21, 22]; (ii) there is a correlation between the levels of deposited A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 in the cerebral parenchyma in the NCs, MCI, and sporadic AD brains [23]; and (iii) lipid raft-nonassociated \\u03b3-secretase activity in the AD brains increases the generation of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 from brain cortices, and these released A\\u03b2s into the extracellular space probably form senile plaques [23]. Thus, not only A\\u03b2 in the CSF but also its deposition in the brain parenchyma depends on \\u03b3-secretase activities. Based on these characteristics of \\u03b3-secretase in sporadic AD, we reassessed the mechanism of A\\u03b2 generation and \\u03b3-secretase activity in PS1 mutants using human CSF and in vitro \\u03b3-secretase assays. CSF samples from FAD participants showed low levels of A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 but not some A\\u03b243. Surprisingly, although lipid raft-associated \\u03b3-secretase activity, which was prepared from mutant PS1 stably expressing cells, showed decreased A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, and some A\\u03b242 generation in the in vitro \\u03b3-secretase assay, the level of A\\u03b243 was the same as the level of WT PS1. This \\u03b3-secretase activity was distinctly different from the alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity found in those with sporadic AD [21]. Liquid chromatography\\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that this altered A\\u03b243 generation was not only from A\\u03b246 but also from A\\u03b248 in the PS1 mutants, despite different stepwise processing pathways. The extent of switching A\\u03b243 generation might reflect FAD onset. The previously measured CSF samples of participants with sporadic AD, MCI, and cognitively NCs were described previously [21]. Briefly, we included 24 participants with AD (mild-to-moderate AD; 50\\u201386 years old), 19 participants with MCI (57\\u201382 years old), and 21 cognitively NC participants (61\\u201389 years old). The CSF samples from 5 participants with (symptomatic) FAD (mutant PS1; T116N, L173F, G209R, L286V, and L381V) were from Niigata University Hospital, and 1 patient with FAD (mutant PS1; L85P) was from Osaka University Hospital.

After brief centrifugation, aliquots of CSF collected were transferred to polypropylene tubes (0.25\\u20130.5\\u2009mL), which were kept at \\u221280\\u2009\\u00b0C until use.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Mutations in the transmembrane domain of amyloid \\u03b2-protein precursor (APP) associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) can alter the ratio of aggregation-prone 42-residue A\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242) to 40-residue A\\u03b2 (A\\u03b240). However, APP substrate is proteolyzed processively by \\u03b3-secretase along two pathways: A\\u03b249\\u2192A\\u03b246\\u2192A\\u03b243\\u2192A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b248\\u2192A\\u03b245\\u2192A\\u03b242\\u2192A\\u03b238.

To address this, we carried out systematic and quantitative analyses of all tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts from proteolysis of wild-type and 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by purified \\u03b3-secretase. These small peptides, including FAD-mutant forms, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by establishing concentration curves for each of 32 standards.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

To address this, we carried out systematic and quantitative analyses of all tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts from proteolysis of wild-type and 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by purified \\u03b3-secretase. These small peptides, including FAD-mutant forms, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by establishing concentration curves for each of 32 standards. APP intracellular domain (AICD) coproducts were quantified by immunoblot, and the ratio of AICD products corresponding to A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 was determined by mass spectrometry. Levels of individual A\\u03b2 peptides were determined by subtracting levels of peptide coproducts associated with degradation from those associated with production.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238. We note that \\u03b3-secretase processes A\\u03b243 into A\\u03b240 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5\\u20131 \\u03bcM) (30). Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u03bcM A\\u03b242, for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism.

Via its proteolytic component presenilin (Li et al., 2000; Wolfe et al., 1999), \\u03b3-secretase processes the TMD of APP into A\\u03b2 peptides of differing lengths, mostly producing a more benign A\\u03b2 species 40 amino acids in length, termed A\\u03b240, as well as lesser amounts of a longer, more aggregation prone and pathogenic species, A\\u03b242. The total amount of A\\u03b242, as well as the ratio of A\\u03b242/40, are thought to be key mediators of A\\u03b2 pathogenesis, a hypothesis strongly supported by the fact that nearly all the 200-plus autosomal-dominant familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin-1, -2 and APP increase the A\\u03b242/40 ratio (see www.alzforum.org/mutations). Due to the strong link between \\u03b3-secretase catalyzed A\\u03b2 formation and AD pathogenesis, the development of \\u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics has been of high interest over the past two decades (Golde et al., 2013; De Strooper, 2014). Both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and a \\u03b3-secretase modulator (GSM), the latter working by an unknown mechanism to influence \\u03b3-secretase to produce shorter, presumably less pathogenic A\\u03b2 species, have failed in recent clinical trials. The failure of GSIs is due at least in part to toxicities from cleavage inhibition of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates such as Notch (Doody et al., 2013; Golde et al., 2013). Little is known about how \\u03b3-secretase recognizes the transmembrane domain of substrates, given that no consensus amino acid cleavage motif has been identified for the more than one hundred \\u03b3-secretase substrates discovered to date (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011). Unfortunately, the further development of safe and effective \\u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics has been held back by a fundamental lack of understanding of how \\u03b3-secretase recognizes and cleaves the TMDs of its many substrates, especially APP. Elucidation of this basic mechanism should at the very least add to our understanding of how A\\u03b2 is produced and may also aid in the development of safe and effective disease-modifying therapeutics. Mass spectrometry studies have identified a complex mixture of products generated from \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s cleavage of the transmembrane domain of APP (Matsumura et al., 2014). Looking at the formation of these products over time, it is apparent that the TMD of APP is mostly processed via two major pathways. \\u03b3-secretase predominantly initiates endoproteolysis at a so-called epsilon (\\u03b5) cleavage site\\u2014after Leu49 or Thr48, generating A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 and two different APP intracellular domains (AICD), AICD 50\\u201399 or AICD 49\\u201399, respectively (Kakuda et al., 2006; Sato et al., 2003). A\\u03b249 and A\\u03b248 are then sequentially cleaved in increments of three amino acids to produce mostly A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242, respectively (Takami et al., 2009).

Despite considerable interest in developing \\u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics for the treatment of AD, the precise mechanism by which \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 has remained elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that \\u03b3-secretase catalysis is driven by the stabilization of an enzyme-substrate scission complex via three distinct amino-acid-binding pockets in the enzyme\\u2019s active site, providing the mechanism by which \\u03b3-secretase preferentially cleaves APP in three amino acid increments. Substrate occupancy of these three pockets occurs after initial substrate binding but precedes catalysis, suggesting a conformational change in substrate may be required for cleavage. We uncover and exploit substrate cleavage preferences dictated by these three pockets to investigate the mechanism by which familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease mutations within APP increase the production of pathogenic A\\u03b2 species. DOI:\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17578.001 Individuals with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease generally have deposits known as \\u201camyloid plaques\\u201d in the brain. These plaques are made up of a mixture of molecules called amyloid beta peptides that clump together and are thought to be a key cause of the disease. The amyloid beta peptides vary in size; the larger peptides tend to be more prone to forming clumps than the smaller ones and are thus more toxic to the brain. An enzyme called gamma-secretase makes amyloid beta peptides by cutting up a protein called APP. Proteins are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids and studies using a technique called mass spectrometry show that gamma-secretase cuts APP in segments of three amino acids at a time. The size of the amyloid beta peptides produced is determined by the positions in APP that gamma-secretase selects to cut. Therefore, understanding how the enzyme works could provide new opportunities for developing drugs to treat Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Here, Bolduc et al. found that the human gamma-secretase enzyme has sites that amino acids in APP can bind to that help to guide the enzyme to cut APP by three amino acids at a time. These binding sites control where the enzyme cuts APP and therefore determines which amyloid peptides are produced. Previous studies have linked several naturally occurring mutations in the gene encoding APP to inherited forms of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Bolduc et al. now reveal that several of these mutations affect the places that gamma-secretase cuts APP to produce amyloid peptides. These findings may be helpful for developing drugs that could manipulate gamma-secretase to produce smaller, less harmful amyloid peptides. Gamma-secretase can cut many other proteins, and so a future challenge will be to find out if the enzyme cuts these other proteins in the same way that it cuts APP.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42 and Aβ43, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Trambauer et al., 2019; Kakuda et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition. These biomarkers can guide clinical decision-making and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, including neuroimaging techniques (such as PET scans detecting amyloid deposition) and CSF analysis for Aβ peptides, have significant clinical relevance. They assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and facilitate the identification of patients who may benefit from GSEC-targeted therapies. The use of these biomarkers in clinical trials can also help stratify patients based on their likelihood of response to GSEC modulators, thereby optimizing trial outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches in AD treatment. The correlation between CSF Aβ levels and brain deposition further emphasizes the role of these biomarkers in understanding GSEC activity and its implications for AD (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis. A\\u03b2 peptides were purchased from rPeptide, resuspended in DMSO at 500 \\u03bcM, aliquoted into single use 10 \\u03bcl aliquots and stored at \\u201380 \\u00b0C.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \" presented with language disturbance [17]. Recently, A\\u03b243 generation and deposition were found to be increased in the brains of those carrying FAD mutations in PS1 [13, 14]. These studies raise the possibility that A\\u03b243 plays a pivotal role in the development of FAD. \\u03b3-Secretase generates each A\\u03b2 under two pathways. At first, A\\u03b249 and A\\u03b248 are cleaved from APP. A\\u03b249 is successively cleaved, mostly to A\\u03b240, via A\\u03b246 and A\\u03b243, while A\\u03b248 is similarly cleaved to A\\u03b238 via A\\u03b245 and A\\u03b242. Of note, the most abundant species, A\\u03b240, is derived not from A\\u03b242 but from A\\u03b243. Moreover, A\\u03b238 is derived mainly from A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 [18\\u201320]. These sequential A\\u03b2 generation mechanisms have been referred to as stepwise processing [18\\u201320]. We previously reported that (i) the levels of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 are proportional, and the levels of A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b240 are also proportional in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sporadic AD participants, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, and cognitively normal controls (NCs). The levels of A\\u03b2 concentration in the CSF might reflect lipid raft-associated \\u03b3-secretase activity from brain cortices [21, 22]; (ii) there is a correlation between the levels of deposited A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 in the cerebral parenchyma in the NCs, MCI, and sporadic AD brains [23]; and (iii) lipid raft-nonassociated \\u03b3-secretase activity in the AD brains increases the generation of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 from brain cortices, and these released A\\u03b2s into the extracellular space probably form senile plaques [23]. Thus, not only A\\u03b2 in the CSF but also its deposition in the brain parenchyma depends on \\u03b3-secretase activities. Based on these characteristics of \\u03b3-secretase in sporadic AD, we reassessed the mechanism of A\\u03b2 generation and \\u03b3-secretase activity in PS1 mutants using human CSF and in vitro \\u03b3-secretase assays. CSF samples from FAD participants showed low levels of A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 but not some A\\u03b243. Surprisingly, although lipid raft-associated \\u03b3-secretase activity, which was prepared from mutant PS1 stably expressing cells, showed decreased A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, and some A\\u03b242 generation in the in vitro \\u03b3-secretase assay, the level of A\\u03b243 was the same as the level of WT PS1. This \\u03b3-secretase activity was distinctly different from the alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity found in those with sporadic AD [21]. Liquid chromatography\\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that this altered A\\u03b243 generation was not only from A\\u03b246 but also from A\\u03b248 in the PS1 mutants, despite different stepwise processing pathways. The extent of switching A\\u03b243 generation might reflect FAD onset. The previously measured CSF samples of participants with sporadic AD, MCI, and cognitively NCs were described previously [21]. Briefly, we included 24 participants with AD (mild-to-moderate AD; 50\\u201386 years old), 19 participants with MCI (57\\u201382 years old), and 21 cognitively NC participants (61\\u201389 years old). The CSF samples from 5 participants with (symptomatic) FAD (mutant PS1; T116N, L173F, G209R, L286V, and L381V) were from Niigata University Hospital, and 1 patient with FAD (mutant PS1; L85P) was from Osaka University Hospital. CSF (10\\u201315\\u2009mL) was collected in a polypropylene or polystyrene tube and gently inverted. After brief centrifugation, aliquots of CSF collected were transferred to polypropylene tubes (0.25\\u20130.5\\u2009mL), which were kept at \\u221280\\u2009\\u00b0C until use. The CSF concentrations of A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 were quantified using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (cat NOs. 277\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42 and Aβ43, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Trambauer et al., 2019; Kakuda et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition. These biomarkers can guide clinical decision-making and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, including neuroimaging techniques (such as PET scans detecting amyloid deposition) and CSF analysis for Aβ peptides, have significant clinical relevance. They assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and facilitate the identification of patients who may benefit from GSEC-targeted therapies. The use of these biomarkers in clinical trials can also help stratify patients based on their likelihood of response to GSEC modulators, thereby optimizing trial outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches in AD treatment. The correlation between CSF Aβ levels and brain deposition further emphasizes the role of these biomarkers in understanding GSEC activity and its implications for AD (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions.

Despite considerable interest in developing \\u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics for the treatment of AD, the precise mechanism by which \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 has remained elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that \\u03b3-secretase catalysis is driven by the stabilization of an enzyme-substrate scission complex via three distinct amino-acid-binding pockets in the enzyme\\u2019s active site, providing the mechanism by which \\u03b3-secretase preferentially cleaves APP in three amino acid increments. Substrate occupancy of these three pockets occurs after initial substrate binding but precedes catalysis, suggesting a conformational change in substrate may be required for cleavage. We uncover and exploit substrate cleavage preferences dictated by these three pockets to investigate the mechanism by which familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease mutations within APP increase the production of pathogenic A\\u03b2 species. DOI:\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17578.001 Individuals with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease generally have deposits known as \\u201camyloid plaques\\u201d in the brain. These plaques are made up of a mixture of molecules called amyloid beta peptides that clump together and are thought to be a key cause of the disease. The amyloid beta peptides vary in size; the larger peptides tend to be more prone to forming clumps than the smaller ones and are thus more toxic to the brain. An enzyme called gamma-secretase makes amyloid beta peptides by cutting up a protein called APP. Proteins are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids and studies using a technique called mass spectrometry show that gamma-secretase cuts APP in segments of three amino acids at a time. The size of the amyloid beta peptides produced is determined by the positions in APP that gamma-secretase selects to cut. Therefore, understanding how the enzyme works could provide new opportunities for developing drugs to treat Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Here, Bolduc et al. found that the human gamma-secretase enzyme has sites that amino acids in APP can bind to that help to guide the enzyme to cut APP by three amino acids at a time. These binding sites control where the enzyme cuts APP and therefore determines which amyloid peptides are produced. Previous studies have linked several naturally occurring mutations in the gene encoding APP to inherited forms of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Bolduc et al. now reveal that several of these mutations affect the places that gamma-secretase cuts APP to produce amyloid peptides. These findings may be helpful for developing drugs that could manipulate gamma-secretase to produce smaller, less harmful amyloid peptides. Gamma-secretase can cut many other proteins, and so a future challenge will be to find out if the enzyme cuts these other proteins in the same way that it cuts APP.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017).

Although the molecular basis of AD remains controversial, the amyloid hypothesis, extensively supported by genetics, cell biology, biochemistry and animal studies, has dominated the field of AD research [7\\u20139]. \\u03b3-secretase is a multisubunit protease complex that cleaves several type \\u0399 single-pass transmembrane proteins at residues within their transmembrane domains [10]. It is an integral membrane protein, comprising four parts: presenilin (PS), nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective 1 and presenilin enhancer 2 [11, 12]. PS is the catalytic subunit of \\u03b3-secretase [13], whereas the other three subunits are involved in assembly, maturation and stability of the complex [14, 15]. The best-studied substrates of \\u03b3-secretase are APP [5, 6] and Notch receptors [16], both of which are of great physiological and pathological importance. Owing to the central role of \\u03b3-secretase in A\\u03b2 peptide generation and AD pathology, inhibitors and modulators of \\u03b3-secretase have been considered as AD therapeutics, yet little success has been achieved in clinical trials, possibly because of the complexity of substrate recognition and catalytic processing. Although mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic PS component of \\u03b3-secretase are strongly associated with early-onset FAD, many disease-associated mutations surprisingly cause a partial loss of function in the \\u03b3-secretase complex [17\\u201319]. Although recently the near-atomic structure of \\u03b3-secretase has been solved [20\\u201322], the relationship between \\u03b3-secretase and its FAD-linked APP substrates remains ambiguous. In this study, we have established a variant of the Tango protein\\u2013protein interaction assay [23] as a simple and sensitive tool to investigate the cleavage of C99 by \\u03b3-secretase in cells. This assay measures the total amount of C99 cleaved, that is, the epsilon-cleavage of C99 irrespective of the number of secondary cleavage events, and which we have therefore termed \\u2018epsilon-cleavage\\u2019 assay (Figure 1a). We tested the effect of all FAD-linked C99 mutations and found that a significant portion of FAD-linked APP mutant proteins became partially resistant to \\u03b3-secretase cleavage. In addition, the APP mutations can be divided into two distinct groups, based on whether the mutations alter residues N-terminal (group 1) or C-terminal (group 2) to the A\\u03b242 cleavage site. Group 1 mutations have subtle effects on cleavage efficiency and A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 specificity. In contrast, group 2 mutations cause partial resistance to \\u03b3-secretase cleavage and dramatically skewed cleavage specificity toward A\\u03b242 production. Unexpectedly, mutations that change the positively charged property at residue 53 nearly abolish APP cleavage by \\u03b3-secretase. On the basis of these data, we propose a substrate and charge-recognition model for \\u03b3-secretase and APP, which we have validated by Notch substrate cleavage. These results provide a structure\\u2013activity relationship profile of the FAD-linked APP mutations as well as molecular insights into substrate recognition and cleavage of APP and Notch receptors by \\u03b3-secretase. To investigate the relationship between \\u03b3-secretase and its C99 substrate, we developed the \\u03b3-secretase epsilon-cleavage assay, which was derived from the cell-based Tango assay [23] and was similar to the Gal4-UAS or Gal4-VP16 systems used previously for A\\u03b2 cleavage [24, 25].

It is characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain that mainly consist of aggregated amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) peptides. Aggregation-prone monomeric A\\u03b2 peptides are proteolytic cleavage products of amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose cleavage by \\u03b2-secretase generates a membrane-bound fragment that contains the C-terminal 99 residues (C99). This fragment is further cleaved by \\u03b3-secretase into the intracellular AICD50 peptide and extracellular 37\\u201342 amino-acid amyloid A\\u03b2 peptides. A\\u03b2 can oligomerize and form higher-order fibrils that give rise to A\\u03b2 plaques, whose primary component is the abnormally folded fibrillar form of A\\u03b2 [2, 3]. It has also been hypothesized that the aberrant accumulation of the more insoluble and aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 (42 amino acid A\\u03b2) over A\\u03b240 is an important trigger for the development and pathogenesis of AD [4]. In an alternative, non-amyloidogenic processing pathway, APP is sequentially cleaved by \\u03b1 secretase to generate a C-terminal 83-residue fragment, and then cleaved by \\u03b3-secretase into AICD50 and non-plaque-forming extracellular peptides [5]. Many familial AD (FAD)-linked mutations have been found in the genes encoding \\u03b3-secretase and APP, which have led to the hypothesis that pathological processing of C99 and the subsequent formation of A\\u03b2-containing plaques are causally related to AD pathogenesis [6].

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

The process begins with \\u03b2-secretase and then \\u03b3-secretase cleaves the C-terminal fragment of APP, predominantly through two pathways. Initial cleavage at the epsilon (\\u03b5) site yields A\\u03b249 and A\\u03b248, which are further processed into A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242, respectively.

These plaques are comprised of aggregates of A\\u03b2 peptides, which are formed by the sequential cleavage of the membrane embedded amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two proteases\\u2014\\u03b2-secretase first removes the ectodomain of APP, then \\u03b3-secretase cleaves the remaining C-terminal fragment within its transmembrane domain (TMD) to liberate A\\u03b2 from cellular membranes. Via its proteolytic component presenilin (Li et al., 2000; Wolfe et al., 1999), \\u03b3-secretase processes the TMD of APP into A\\u03b2 peptides of differing lengths, mostly producing a more benign A\\u03b2 species 40 amino acids in length, termed A\\u03b240, as well as lesser amounts of a longer, more aggregation prone and pathogenic species, A\\u03b242. The total amount of A\\u03b242, as well as the ratio of A\\u03b242/40, are thought to be key mediators of A\\u03b2 pathogenesis, a hypothesis strongly supported by the fact that nearly all the 200-plus autosomal-dominant familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin-1, -2 and APP increase the A\\u03b242/40 ratio (see www.alzforum.org/mutations). Due to the strong link between \\u03b3-secretase catalyzed A\\u03b2 formation and AD pathogenesis, the development of \\u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics has been of high interest over the past two decades (Golde et al., 2013; De Strooper, 2014). Both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and a \\u03b3-secretase modulator (GSM), the latter working by an unknown mechanism to influence \\u03b3-secretase to produce shorter, presumably less pathogenic A\\u03b2 species, have failed in recent clinical trials. The failure of GSIs is due at least in part to toxicities from cleavage inhibition of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates such as Notch (Doody et al., 2013; Golde et al., 2013). Little is known about how \\u03b3-secretase recognizes the transmembrane domain of substrates, given that no consensus amino acid cleavage motif has been identified for the more than one hundred \\u03b3-secretase substrates discovered to date (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011). Unfortunately, the further development of safe and effective \\u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics has been held back by a fundamental lack of understanding of how \\u03b3-secretase recognizes and cleaves the TMDs of its many substrates, especially APP. Elucidation of this basic mechanism should at the very least add to our understanding of how A\\u03b2 is produced and may also aid in the development of safe and effective disease-modifying therapeutics. Mass spectrometry studies have identified a complex mixture of products generated from \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s cleavage of the transmembrane domain of APP (Matsumura et al., 2014). Looking at the formation of these products over time, it is apparent that the TMD of APP is mostly processed via two major pathways. \\u03b3-secretase predominantly initiates endoproteolysis at a so-called epsilon (\\u03b5) cleavage site\\u2014after Leu49 or Thr48, generating A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 and two different APP intracellular domains (AICD), AICD 50\\u201399 or AICD 49\\u201399, respectively (Kakuda et al., 2006; Sato et al., 2003). A\\u03b249 and A\\u03b248 are then sequentially cleaved in increments of three amino acids to produce mostly A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242, respectively (Takami et al., 2009). The two major pathways are therefore A\\u03b249 \\u2192 A\\u03b246 \\u2192 A\\u03b243 \\u2192 A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b248 \\u2192 A\\u03b245 \\u2192 A\\u03b242 (Figure 1A) (Fernandez et al., 2014; Takami et al., 2009).

Mutations in the transmembrane domain of amyloid \\u03b2-protein precursor (APP) associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) can alter the ratio of aggregation-prone 42-residue A\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242) to 40-residue A\\u03b2 (A\\u03b240). However, APP substrate is proteolyzed processively by \\u03b3-secretase along two pathways: A\\u03b249\\u2192A\\u03b246\\u2192A\\u03b243\\u2192A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b248\\u2192A\\u03b245\\u2192A\\u03b242\\u2192A\\u03b238. Effects of FAD mutations on each proteolytic step are unknown, largely due to difficulties in detecting and quantifying longer A\\u03b2 peptides. To address this, we carried out systematic and quantitative analyses of all tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts from proteolysis of wild-type and 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by purified \\u03b3-secretase. These small peptides, including FAD-mutant forms, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by establishing concentration curves for each of 32 standards. APP intracellular domain (AICD) coproducts were quantified by immunoblot, and the ratio of AICD products corresponding to A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 was determined by mass spectrometry. Levels of individual A\\u03b2 peptides were determined by subtracting levels of peptide coproducts associated with degradation from those associated with production. This method was validated for A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 by specific ELISAs and production of equimolar levels of A\\u03b2 and AICD. Not all mutant substrates led to increased A\\u03b242/40. However, all 14 disease-causing mutations led to inefficient processing of longer forms of A\\u03b2 \\u2265 45 residues. In addition, the effects of certain mutations provided insight into the mechanism of processive proteolysis: intermediate A\\u03b2 peptides apparently remain bound for subsequent trimming and are not released and reassociated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nCerebral plaques composed of the amyloid \\u03b2-protein (A\\u03b2) are a defining pathological feature of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (1).

A\\u03b2 peptides of 38 to 43 residues are secreted, with the aggregation-prone 42-residue form (A\\u03b242) being predominantly and disproportionally deposited in AD plaques (4).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42 and Aβ43, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Trambauer et al., 2019; Kakuda et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition. These biomarkers can guide clinical decision-making and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",

Importantly, these compounds do not accelerate the production of the potentially toxic product BACE1-C-terminal fragment (C99) (Toyn et al., 2016). In all species, research suggests that \\u03b3-secretase modulator treatment decrease A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 levels while increasing A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b237 by a corresponding amount. Therefore, the mechanism of action of \\u03b3-secretase modulators may translate well across species, validating its therapeutic strategy for utility in AD (Toyn et al., 2016). Other translational research across species has shown increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following A\\u03b2 immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007). Thereby, translation of inflammatory mechanisms and their peripheral markers may benefit from investigation of changes in microglial markers. However, when interpreting and comparing immune markers from mice caution is warranted, as recent evidence suggests that these markers do not translate well to human inflammatory diseases (Seok et al., 2013). Moreover, increased levels of isoprostanes have been shown in Tg2576 mice prior to plaque formation (Pratico et al., 2001), suggesting isoprostane levels may be useful as a predictive biomarker. Neurofilament light in bodily fluid constitutes a biomarker of neurodegeneration reflecting its translational value in system models and in clinical settings (Bacioglu et al., 2016). The earliest (current) detectable A\\u03b2 deposition in humans is the formation of diffuse plaques, whereas in the brain of Tg2576 mice diffuse plaques are not observed until 12 months of age, which is 4 months after biochemically detectable alterations of A\\u03b2 (Kawarabayashi et al., 2001). The most common observation in AD patients is minor amounts of A\\u03b240 deposited in the brain, whereas in 33% of patients great amounts of this A\\u03b2 variant are detected. Intriguingly, this latter group of patients also display substantial amyloid angiopathy (amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain) (Gravina et al., 1995). Similarly, the Tg2576 mouse model displays marked angiopathy and the deposition of a large amount of A\\u03b240 (Gravina et al., 1995). Generally CSF A\\u03b240 levels are much higher in patients compared to mice, while brain concentrations are similar (Karelina et al., 2017). In terms of plasma concentrations of A\\u03b240, this is highly similar between patients and mice, and therefore the greater A\\u03b240 concentrations observed in human CSF may likely reflect a higher brain production of the peptide (Karelina et al., 2017). In terms of the similarity between system models and patients, and specifically transgenic mice and human patients, mice and humans share virtually the same set of genes. Almost every gene found in mice or humans has been observed in a closely related form in the other. To look directly at differences along the AD disease cascade, we compare pathological events between the 3xTg AD mouse model and sporadic AD patients (Figure 4). The 3xTg AD mouse model develops amyloid and tau pathology, including amyloid plaques and NFTs (Oddo et al., 2003).

Other studies, however, did not find significant differences in levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342 or A\\u03b21\\u201340 compared to a placebo group (Siemers et al. 2006; Galasko et al. 2007; Fleisher et al. 2008; Portelius, Zetterberg, et al. 2012; Doody et al. 2013; Imbimbo et al. 2013; Doody et al. 2015). Peptidomic approaches could also be useful in the identification of biomarkers to verify target engagement. The analysis of the CSF peptidome by liquid chromatography and mass MS prior to and following a single dose of the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat led (Holtta et al. 2016) to the identification of 11 peptides that were altered following pharmaceutical intervention. The effects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy have also been evaluated using CSF biomarkers, although data are more difficult to interpret than in the studies of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds, AN1792 and CAD-106, were able to show changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers (Gilman et al. 2005; Winblad et al. 2012). Likewise, treatment with the monoclonal antibody bapineuzumab did not change amyloid marker levels in CSF (Blennow et al. 2012). In contrast, patients treated with solanezumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target soluble A\\u03b2, did show an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF (Siemers et al. 2010; Farlow et al. 2012; Doody et al. 2014).

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Panelists agreed on the clinical workspace of the workflow (specialist outpatient service), the stage of application (prodromal and mild dementia), and the patient age window (biomarker use strongly encouraged below 70 years and of limited usefulness over age 85). The workflow is patient-centered and features three levels of assessment (W): W1 defines eleven clinical profiles based on integrated results of neuropsychology, MRI atrophy patterns, and blood tests; W2 describes the first-line biomarkers according to W1 versus clinical suspicion; and W3 suggests the second-line biomarkers when the results of first-line biomarkers are inconsistent with the diagnostic hypothesis, uninformative or inconclusive. More specifically, CSF biomarkers are first-line in the suspect of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) and when inconsistent neuropsychological and MRI findings hinder a clear diagnostic hypothesis; dopamine SPECT/PET for those leading to suspect Lewy body spectrum. FDG-PET is first-line for the clinical profiles leading to suspect frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor tauopathies and is followed by CSF biomarkers in the case of atypical metabolic patterns, when an underlying AD etiology is conceivable. None of these biomarkers is indicated when clinical profiles suggest vascular cognitive impairment or other neurological disorders. Conclusions: The workflow will promote consistency in diagnosing neurocognitive disorders across countries and rational use of resources. The initiative has some limitations, mainly linked to the Delphi procedure (e.g., kick-off questions were driven by the moderators, answers are driven by the Delphi panel composition, a subtle phrasing of the questions may drive answers, and 70% threshold for convergence is conventional). However, the diagnostic workflow will be able to help clinicians achieve an early and sustainable etiological diagnosis and enable the use of disease-modifying drugs as soon as they become available.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Trambauer et al., 2019; Kakuda et al., 2021).\n",

      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42 and Aβ43, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Trambauer et al., 2019; Kakuda et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by the observation that increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following Aβ immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice suggest a beneficial inflammatory response (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition. Neurofilament light protein is also emerging as a biomarker of neurodegeneration, reflecting its translational value in both animal models and clinical settings (Bacioglu et al., 2016). These biomarkers can guide clinical decision-making and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, including neuroimaging techniques (such as PET scans detecting amyloid deposition) and CSF analysis for Aβ peptides, have significant clinical relevance. They assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and facilitate the identification of patients who may benefit from GSEC-targeted therapies. The use of these biomarkers in clinical trials can also help stratify patients based on their likelihood of response to GSEC modulators, thereby optimizing trial outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches in AD treatment. The correlation between CSF Aβ levels and brain deposition further emphasizes the role of these biomarkers in understanding GSEC activity and its implications for AD (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022).

The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

Inversely, the Icelandic mutation (A673T) seems to be protective against AD by decreasing \\u03b2-secretase cleavage and thus reducing by 40% the amyloidogenic fragments sAPP\\u03b2 and A\\u03b2 (17, 39). The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50). Further studies also revealed a very complex cleavage of APP-CTFs by \\u03b3-secretase, since it takes place within the membrane and successively at several sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6-, \\u03b3- and \\u03b3\\u2032). The first endopeptidase cleavage (\\u025b-cleavage) can occur at two distinct sites leading to the generation of A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249, which is then shortened by sequential carboxypeptidase cleavages (trimming) at \\u03b6, \\u03b3-and \\u03b3\\u2032-sites, occurring at each three or four residues and via two distinct product lines (A\\u03b249 > A\\u03b246 > A\\u03b243 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b237) or (A\\u03b248 > A\\u03b245 > A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b238) and the final occurrence of peptides of varying lengths but two major species of 40 or 42 amino acid residues, respectively (51).

Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression.

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242. The compound BMS-932,481 (Soares et al, 2016) had the desired effects on A\\u03b2: decreased A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, and increased A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 without effecting total A\\u03b2 in humans.

However, the recent successes of A\\u03b2 targeted trials have assuaged those doubts. In this review, we discussed the evolution of the amyloid cascade hypothesis over the last 30 years and summarized its application in Alzheimer\\u2019s diagnosis and modification.

In 1984, Glenner & Wong discovered that the amyloid \\u03b2 protein (A\\u03b2) is the central component of extracellular amyloid plaques in AD.1 Since then, A\\u03b2 has been considered as a driver of Alzheimer\\u2019s pathological processes and the \\u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\\u201d has become a leading theory of AD pathogenesis.2 Over the past decades, targeting A\\u03b2 has been the main direction of developing AD treatment.3\\u20136 However, the repetitive failures of A\\u03b2-targeted clinical trials have cast considerable doubt on this hypothesis. Anti-A\\u03b2 therapy has now become a significant controversy in AD drug development and treatment. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential cleavage of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. However, the non-amyloidogenic pathway is the predominant pathway in vivo.7 APP is mostly cleaved first by \\u03b1-secretase within A\\u03b2 domain at the A\\u03b2 Leu17 site in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, generating a secreted form of APP (sAPP\\u03b1) and an 83-amino acid membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF) C83, thus precluding A\\u03b2 production. The beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the \\u03b2-secretase, and its homolog BACE2, the \\u03b8-secretase, also contribute to the non-amyloidogenic pathway.7,8 Under physiological conditions, BACE1 predominantly processes APP at the A\\u03b2 Glu11 \\u03b2-secretase site to generate C89, and \\u03b3-secretase cleaves C89 to produce a truncated A\\u03b211-40.7,8 BACE2 cleaves APP at the A\\u03b2 Phe20 \\u03b8-secretase site to generate C80 and precludes A\\u03b2 generation.9\\u201311 Two enzymatic cleavages of APP by\",\n",

      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by the observation that increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following Aβ immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice suggest a beneficial inflammatory response (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007).\n",

Peptidomic approaches could also be useful in the identification of biomarkers to verify target engagement. The analysis of the CSF peptidome by liquid chromatography and mass MS prior to and following a single dose of the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat led (Holtta et al. 2016) to the identification of 11 peptides that were altered following pharmaceutical intervention. The effects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy have also been evaluated using CSF biomarkers, although data are more difficult to interpret than in the studies of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds, AN1792 and CAD-106, were able to show changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers (Gilman et al. 2005; Winblad et al. 2012).

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

In summary, trials with \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have clearly shown that CSF biomarkers can be used to verify drug-target engagement and a similar paradigm can be applied to other therapeutic strategies. There is evidence that adequate markers of target engagement might not necessarily capture disease-modifying effects (Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015). The theragnostic value of each biomarker should be individually assessed based on its association to cognitive or functional endpoints. To date, all drugs attempting to modify the course of AD have failed in their primary clinical endpoints. For this reason, it is difficult to address the question of whether CSF biomarkers can predict clinical response. In addition, the total number of patients with CSF measures in clinical trials is still low, further limiting the possibilities to draw firm conclusions. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as surrogate markers of disease modification and as indicators of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The trial with AN1792, the first active A\\u03b2 immunisation study showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo (Gilman et al. 2005). However, treatment with CAD106, another active immunotherapy, did not change the levels of Tau or pTau (Winblad et al. 2012). Most trials with passive immunisation have also included Tau markers in CSF in a subset of subjects. Treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels in both the phase II and phase III trials (Blennow et al. 2012; Salloway et al. 2014). However, this effect was not observed after treatment with solaneuzumab (Doody et al. 2014). These findings could be interpreted as if treatments that act on fibrillar A\\u03b2 have a greater impact on downstream neurodegeneration than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2 (Lleo et al. 2015). Results from ongoing studies with these and other anti-amyloid treatments might shed new biological evidence for the role of CSF markers to detect disease modification. In addition to Tau and pTau, other proteins have been investigated in CSF to monitor the pathophysiological pathways in AD. These novel biomarkers could provide further insights in clinical trials. Tau-independent markers of neuronal damage, such as NF-L, VLP-1, or the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, could give additional information about disease modification effects in trials with anti-Tau therapies, in which levels of total Tau and pTau could be the result of target engagement (Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Synaptic markers (NG, SNAP-25), markers of neuroinflammation/microglial activation (YKL-40 or CCL2) and markers of protein homeostasis and lysosomal dysfunction (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) could be used as indicators of disease progression (Alcolea et al. 2014; Cavedo et al. 2014; Alcolea et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Markers to detect common associated neuropathological comorbidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al.\",\n",

Panelists agreed on the clinical workspace of the workflow (specialist outpatient service), the stage of application (prodromal and mild dementia), and the patient age window (biomarker use strongly encouraged below 70 years and of limited usefulness over age 85). The workflow is patient-centered and features three levels of assessment (W): W1 defines eleven clinical profiles based on integrated results of neuropsychology, MRI atrophy patterns, and blood tests; W2 describes the first-line biomarkers according to W1 versus clinical suspicion; and W3 suggests the second-line biomarkers when the results of first-line biomarkers are inconsistent with the diagnostic hypothesis, uninformative or inconclusive. More specifically, CSF biomarkers are first-line in the suspect of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) and when inconsistent neuropsychological and MRI findings hinder a clear diagnostic hypothesis; dopamine SPECT/PET for those leading to suspect Lewy body spectrum. FDG-PET is first-line for the clinical profiles leading to suspect frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor tauopathies and is followed by CSF biomarkers in the case of atypical metabolic patterns, when an underlying AD etiology is conceivable. None of these biomarkers is indicated when clinical profiles suggest vascular cognitive impairment or other neurological disorders. Conclusions: The workflow will promote consistency in diagnosing neurocognitive disorders across countries and rational use of resources. The initiative has some limitations, mainly linked to the Delphi procedure (e.g., kick-off questions were driven by the moderators, answers are driven by the Delphi panel composition, a subtle phrasing of the questions may drive answers, and 70% threshold for convergence is conventional). However, the diagnostic workflow will be able to help clinicians achieve an early and sustainable etiological diagnosis and enable the use of disease-modifying drugs as soon as they become available.

Although amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid concentration of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b240 reflect the presence of amyloid pathologies, these methods are expensive and/or invasive. To overcome these limitations, studies have focused on the use of blood-based biomarkers. Objectives: We aimed to determine the efficacy of combining plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240, neurofilament light (NfL) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes in detecting positive amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) in a prospective cohort of individuals with and without AD. Methods: Biomarkers were measured using single-molecule array (Simoa) methods in participants who were cognitively unimpaired (CU, n=8), had mild cognitive impairment\",\n",

Notably, p-tau/A\\u03b242 (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 100%) was a good discriminator of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other dementia syndromes [36] (Table 1). Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141]. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein is involved with the transportation of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated as a biomarker of brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [142].

Publications that were not in English were excluded due to the challenges of evaluating the contents as accessible open resources. The most relevant or primary studies were included in this analysis, and replicated contents were omitted along with studies with a small sample size (Figure 1). Studies with important findings of key CSF biomarkers are included in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Of note, key findings of meta-analysis articles are given in Table 1. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

The transmembrane domain of APP, which is embedded in the plasma membrane of human neuronal cells, contains multiple cleavage sites targeted by \\u03b1-, \\u03b2-, and \\u03b3-secretases (35). Orchestration of the secretases produces peptide fragments that are released into the extracellular space, involving neurotrophic activities, synaptic plasticity, and intracellular signaling (Fig. 1C) (36). The sequential cleavage of APP by \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases (i.e., amyloidogenic pathway) generates amyloidogenic A\\u03b2 peptides with 37-43 amino acid residues, whereas the combination of \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases guides the non-amyloidogenic secretion pathway that forms soluble P3 fragments. In the amyloidogenic secretion pathway, \\u03b2-secretase generates soluble APP beta peptide (sAPP\\u03b2) and the APP C-terminal fragment (C99) by the cleavage of APP; then, \\u03b3-secretase splits C99 into the A\\u03b2 peptide and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The length of A\\u03b2 proteins released to the extracellular region of neuronal cells typically terminates at either the A\\u03b240 or A\\u03b242 position, while AICD starts at the 49th or 50th position of C99. Although proteolytic cleavage mediated by the multiple secretases is the primary mechanism that determines the lengths of A\\u03b2 peptides, N-terminal truncated isoforms by non-conventional mechanisms (e.g., CuII-mediated self-hydrolysis, metalloproteases) have been reported as well (37). These isoforms share most of the primary structure with A\\u03b242 or A\\u03b240; however, the deletion of several N-terminal amino acid sequences significantly alter the aggregation behaviors of the truncated A\\u03b2 peptides.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Trambauer et al., 2019; Kakuda et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by the observation that increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following Aβ immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice suggest a beneficial inflammatory response (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition.

GSMs can decrease A\\u03b242 levels, enhancing safety as they avoid Notch processing interference. Furthermore, compounds such as tramiprosate and its pro-drug ALZ-801 target amyloid aggregation, with ALZ-801 showing improved pharmacokinetics. While tramiprosate trials failed to demonstrate efficacy, ALZ-801 is posited as a promising clinical candidate. There is no specific mention of combination therapy, tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, or synaptic dysfunction in the excerpt. \\n\\n8\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \" addition to GSIs, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have also been acting as attractive small molecules for alleviating the symptoms of AD (Kounnas et al., 2010; Crump et al., 2013). GSMs may promote further cleavage of A\\u03b242, thus reducing the amount of aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides (Pozdnyakov et al., 2013). In transgenic mice of the AD model, treatment with CHF5074 can markedly reduce brain A\\u03b2 burden without any histological peripheral Notch-mediated toxicity (Imbimbo et al., 2009). CHF5074 shows a dose-dependent manner and well tolerated and safety in mild-to-moderate patients (Ross et al., 2013). This \\u03b3-secretase modulator is a promising therapeutic agent for AD. Besides, the small molecule E2012 is a widely used classic member of the heterocyclic GSM family without affecting Notch processing, aiming at AD by reduction of A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 in a dose-dependent manner (Nakano-Ito et al., 2013). The aggregation of monomeric peptide A\\u03b2 into amyloid fibrils is one of the features and pathogenies of AD. Oligomers, the aggregation intermediates, are toxic and cause neuronal cell death (Haass and Selkoe, 2007; Glabe, 2008). Therefore, inhibiting the formation of oligomers and aggregates is widely studied as a promising therapeutic treatment for Alzheimer's disease (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002). Next, some representative small-molecule agents that can prevent A\\u03b2 aggregation will be introduced (Figure 8). Structures of molecules in preventing amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) aggregation. Tramiprosate is an orally administered small molecule that binds to soluble amyloid, thus inhibiting amyloid aggregation in the brain (Aisen et al., 2007). Preclinical and clinical studies showed that the oral treatment of tramiprosate could reduce oligomeric and fibrillar (plaque) amyloid, diminish hippocampal atrophy, improve cholinergic transmission, and stabilize cognition (Manzano et al., 2020). Although tramiprosate is safe and well tolerated, the clinical trials were terminated in Phase III trial owing to the failure in demonstrating efficacy (Aisen et al., 2011; Herrmann et al., 2011). ALZ-801 is an oral valine-conjugated pro-drug of tramiprosate, providing significantly improved pharmacokinetic variability and gastrointestinal tolerance (Hey et al., 2018b), inhibiting the formation of amyloid oligomers without plaque interaction. 3-Sulfopropanoic acid (3-SPA), the main metabolite of tramiprosate and ALZ-801, is an endogenous molecule that is present in the brain of patients with AD (Hey et al., 2018a). It has an anti-A\\u03b2 aggregation activity in vitro with an efficacy comparable to tramiprosate. ALZ-801 showed excellent oral safety and tolerability in healthy adults and elderly volunteers with significantly improved pharmacokinetic characteristics over oral tramiprosate (Tolar et al., 2020). Therefore, ALZ-801 may be an advanced and markedly improved clinical candidate drug for the treatment of AD (Tolar et al., 2019). Scyllo-inositol, one of the nine structural isomers of inositol (Fenili et al., 2007), can reduce amyloid toxicity and regulate myo-inositol levels to improve cognitive function in patients (Salloway et\",\n",

It lessens brain amyloid burden and restores memory impairments in transgenic mice (Desire et al., 2008; Van Tijn et al., 2008). testosterone, oestrogens, Statins, and protein kinase C activators are other medications that have been studied in clinical trials and have the ability to enhance \\u03b1-secretase activity. However, there isn't any proof right now that they're used in AD. In phase 2 clinical trials, etazolate (EHT 0202) is a \\u03b1-secretase stimulator that shifts APP processing to the non-amyloidogenic route(Landreth, 2007); Aisen et al., (Aisen et al., 2008). Oral medications for type 2 diabetes called thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, work as \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors by activating the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor.By boosting APP's ubiquitination, activation of these receptors can inhibit the production of \\u03b2-secretase and accelerate its destruction.Although it's unclear whether rosiglitazone can enter the human CNS, pioglitazone can cross the BBB (Henley et al., 2009). PPAR\\u03b3 agonists' therapeutic effects on AD may result from how they affect insulin activity, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammation. The neuropathology of AD appears to be facilitated by insulin resistance and peripheral hyperinsulinemia. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone improve peripheral insulin sensitivity while lowering insulin concentrations, which compete with A\\u03b2 for the insulin-degrading enzyme's concentration (Bolognesi et al., 2009); Aisen et al., (Aisen et al., 2008). A\\u03b2 secretase inhibitor called semagacestat (LY450139), which decreases CSF A\\u03b2 and seems to be well tolerated, is currently undergoing phase 3 clinical studies (Schneider et al., 2005). Other \\u03b3 secretase inhibitors, such as MK0752 in phase 1 and BMS-708163 in phase 2, which has a relatively low risk of Notch-related side effects, are in early clinical trialsAisen et al., (Aisen et al., 2008). The amyloid cascade theory views alterations in tau that result in NFT production as secondary processes, and as a result, this area has mostly been neglected in terms of treatments. The identification of mutations in the human tau gene, which led to the neurodegenerative conditions commonly known as frontotemporal dementia or tauopathies, altered perception.The notion that the alterations in tau found in AD may be responsible for cell death even if they are secondary to A\\u03b2 toxicity stems from the observation that even relatively minor changes in tau can trigger neuronal death (Schenk et al., 2006). Currently, there are two main strategies in this field (Schenk et al., 2006): Numerous studies on tau aggregation have demonstrated that nonphosphorylated tau can form filamentous aggregates, and they have used these systems to search for potential tau aggregation inhibitors. To promote tau aggregation, it include polyanions like heparin, RNA, or arachidonic acid(Schenk et al., 2006); (Davies and Koppel, 2009). There is little disagreement that tau is hyperphosphorylated in the elderly human and/or animal brain, on average it has an approximately 2\\u20133 moles of phosphate per mole of proteinwhile tau isolated from the Alzheimer brain contains 6\\u20138\\u2009moles of phosphate per mole of protein.

In AD, excessive phosphorylation of tau leads to neurotoxicity, synaptic dysfunction, and NFT formation.

Unsurprisingly, clinical trials of AD treatment with \\u03b3\\u2010secretase inhibitors have failed due to their inhibition of Notch cleavage, resulting in abnormalities in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, thymus, and spleen (Imbimbo & Giardina, 2011). Notch\\u2010signaling\\u2010dependent regulation is necessary for the crucial proteins of T\\u2010cell activation and differentiation, including NF\\u2010\\u03baB, T\\u2010bet, IFN\\u2010\\u03b3, and TGF\\u2010\\u03b2, and this regulation can be abolished by \\u03b3\\u2010secretase inhibitors (Amsen et al., 2015; Minter et al., 2005; Palaga et al., 2003; Samon et al., 2008; Shin et al., 2006). The Helbig and Maekawa research groups have shown that Notch signaling can prolong activated CD4+ T\\u2010cell longevity and promote memory CD4+ T\\u2010cell maintenance (Helbig et al., 2012; Maekawa et al., 2015). Furthermore, CD44, a critical regulator that controls T\\u2010cell development and function (Baaten et al., 2012; Graham et al., 2007), has been identified as a novel substrate of \\u03b3\\u2010secretase in vitro (Lammich et al., 2002), implying a novel mechanism of \\u03b3\\u2010secretase in the regulation of T\\u2010cell function. In summary, the role of \\u03b3\\u2010secretase in most biological T\\u2010cell processes suggests that \\u03b3\\u2010secretase inhibitors should be used with caution to avoid affecting normal physiological T\\u2010cell function. Conversely, \\u03b3\\u2010secretase inhibitor treatment may be an effective strategy for the rescue of abnormal T\\u2010cell function under certain conditions. Tau is a microtubule\\u2010binding protein abundant in neurons and is mainly localized on axons and dendrites (Hirokawa et al., 1996; Ittner et al., 2010; Konzack et al., 2007; Utton et al., 2002). The primary role of tau in neurons is to modulate the stability of axonal microtubules by interacting with tubulin. While phosphorylation is a common post\\u2010translational modification of tau (Cleveland et al., 1977; Ksiezak\\u2010Reding et al., 2003; Sengupta et al., 1998), abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau leads to NFT formation and is neurotoxic in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD (Kenessey et al., 1995; Kopke et al., 1993; Ksiezak\\u2010Reding et al., 1992). Under pathological conditions, excessive or abnormal phosphorylation of tau which aggregates into NFTs is responsible for synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death (Guo et al., 2017). Tau\\u2010specific CD4+ T cells are widely distributed in the peripheral blood from the general population (Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2019). These cells collected from either young or healthy elderly donors exhibited reactivity to tau\\u2010 and p\\u2010tau\\u2010derived peptides associated with IL\\u20105 and IFN\\u2010\\u03b3. The presence of the tau\\u2010autoreactive T cells indicates that the thymic selection of CD4+ T cells is not sufficient to eliminate these cells. Furthermore, extravascular T cells are observed in the brains, specifically in the hippocampus, of AD patients, most of which are CD8+ T cells. These extravascular T cells are correlated with tau pathology but not with A\\u03b2 pathology (Merlini et al., 2018), suggesting that T cells could be critical for driving the tau\\u2010dependent phase of the AD pathology.

Importantly, these compounds do not accelerate the production of the potentially toxic product BACE1-C-terminal fragment (C99) (Toyn et al., 2016). In all species, research suggests that \\u03b3-secretase modulator treatment decrease A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 levels while increasing A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b237 by a corresponding amount. Therefore, the mechanism of action of \\u03b3-secretase modulators may translate well across species, validating its therapeutic strategy for utility in AD (Toyn et al., 2016). Other translational research across species has shown increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following A\\u03b2 immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007). Thereby, translation of inflammatory mechanisms and their peripheral markers may benefit from investigation of changes in microglial markers. However, when interpreting and comparing immune markers from mice caution is warranted, as recent evidence suggests that these markers do not translate well to human inflammatory diseases (Seok et al., 2013). Moreover, increased levels of isoprostanes have been shown in Tg2576 mice prior to plaque formation (Pratico et al., 2001), suggesting isoprostane levels may be useful as a predictive biomarker. Neurofilament light in bodily fluid constitutes a biomarker of neurodegeneration reflecting its translational value in system models and in clinical settings (Bacioglu et al., 2016). The earliest (current) detectable A\\u03b2 deposition in humans is the formation of diffuse plaques, whereas in the brain of Tg2576 mice diffuse plaques are not observed until 12 months of age, which is 4 months after biochemically detectable alterations of A\\u03b2 (Kawarabayashi et al., 2001). The most common observation in AD patients is minor amounts of A\\u03b240 deposited in the brain, whereas in 33% of patients great amounts of this A\\u03b2 variant are detected. Intriguingly, this latter group of patients also display substantial amyloid angiopathy (amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain) (Gravina et al., 1995). Similarly, the Tg2576 mouse model displays marked angiopathy and the deposition of a large amount of A\\u03b240 (Gravina et al., 1995). Generally CSF A\\u03b240 levels are much higher in patients compared to mice, while brain concentrations are similar (Karelina et al., 2017). In terms of plasma concentrations of A\\u03b240, this is highly similar between patients and mice, and therefore the greater A\\u03b240 concentrations observed in human CSF may likely reflect a higher brain production of the peptide (Karelina et al., 2017). In terms of the similarity between system models and patients, and specifically transgenic mice and human patients, mice and humans share virtually the same set of genes. Almost every gene found in mice or humans has been observed in a closely related form in the other. To look directly at differences along the AD disease cascade, we compare pathological events between the 3xTg AD mouse model and sporadic AD patients (Figure 4). The 3xTg AD mouse model develops amyloid and tau pathology, including amyloid plaques and NFTs (Oddo et al., 2003).

It has entered the clinical development as a promising disease-modifying treatment for AD. To date, none of the BACE1 inhibitors succeeded in slowing or reversing the progression of AD in clinical trials, owing to the adverse effects or the invalid nature in promoting the cognitive ability. These results might encourage researchers to reconsider whether BACE1 inhibitors are effective therapeutic agents in AD treatment. As well as BACE1 inhibitors, the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase can also reduce A\\u03b2 production and decrease the accumulation of A\\u03b2 oligomers and plaques, providing an effective treatment for AD (Wolfe, 2008; Golde et al., 2010). Therefore, the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators (Figure 7) represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity for AD (Yang et al., 2021). Semagacestat (LY-450139), developed and named by Eli Lily (Henley et al., 2009), was the first \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor (GSI) that entered phase III clinical research. The clinical trials were stopped owing to severe side effects like the cleavage inhibition of other substrates such as Notch signaling proteins and other cell surface receptors (Doody et al., 2015; Aster et al., 2017). To solve this problem, the notch-sparing GSIs were developed such as Avagacestat (BMS-708163), which preferentially inhibited the cleavage of APP over Notch (Gillman et al., 2010). But, BMS-708163 did not show an obvious efficacy in Phase II trials and high doses produced toxicity (Coric et al., 2012, 2015). Begacestat (GSI-953) (Martone et al., 2009) is another GSI which can selectively inhibit the cleavage of APP over Notch, showing a promise in recent Phase I clinical trials (Hopkins, 2012). In healthy human volunteers, the oral administration of a single dose produces dose-dependent changes in plasma A\\u03b2 levels, proving the pharmacodynamic activity of GSI-953 in humans. NIC5-15 is a natural product found in pine bark and many foodstuffs such as soy and carob (Grossman et al., 2009). In transgenic mice, it is proved to diminish the production of A\\u03b21-42 via notch-sparing \\u03b3-secretase inhibition. NIC5-15 has a safe and effectual treatment in improving cognitive function in mild-to-moderate AD patients (Pasinetti et al., 2009). Structures of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators. PF-3084014 is a potent \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor that reduces A\\u03b2 production with an IC50 of 1.2 nM (whole-cell assay) in vitro. It showed a dose-dependent reduction in brain, CSF, and plasma A\\u03b2 in Tg2576 mice as measured (Lanz et al., 2010). In the family of GSIs, BMS-289948 and BMS-299897 are two orally active \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors. They can markedly reduce plasma and brain A\\u03b2 level in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Anderson et al., 2005).

Clinical trials targeting A\\u03b2 production have seen very little success. For example, clinical trials for drugs targeting \\u03b3-secretase, including \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors such as Semagacestat (Eli Lilly) and Avagacesta (Bristol-Myers Squibb) programs have been terminated due to a lack in efficacy and/or appearance of severe side effects. Since the \\u03b3-secretase complex cleaves physiological substrates other than APP such as Notch, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors may affect other physiological functions in addition to APP processing. Similarly, inadequate efficacy and/or severe side effects in clinical trials with BACE1 inhibitors such as Verubecestat and Atabecestat [638\\u2013640] have also been reported. Although inhibition of \\u03b2-secretase activity is predicted to reduce A\\u03b2 production, BACE1 inhibitors were seen to increase cleavage of APP by other secretases, thereby enhancing the production of pathogenic APP metabolites [36]. In addition, BACE1 KO mice exhibit a variety of neurological defects [641\\u2013643], indicating that BACE1 mediates many fundamental functions in brain. In addition, conditional BACE1 deletion in neurons feature axon guidance defects [644], suggesting that BACE1 deletion may have additional non-autonomous roles in neurons. Immunotherapeutic approaches targeting A\\u03b2 have also been subjected to clinical testing. Aducanumab (Biogen/Eisai) is a human monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid \\u03b2 fibrils and soluble oligomers [645]. Recently, Biogen has announced that higher dosages of Aducanumab show 23% improvement in AD patients in one of two phase 3 trials. BAN2401 is a monoclonal antibody targeting large and soluble A\\u03b2 protofibrils. Phase 2 clinical results for BAN2401 indicate that it can remove A\\u03b2 and slow cognitive decline. Phase 3 clinical trials are currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of BAN2401 in patients with mild AD. In these trials, BAN2401 is being tested in asymptomatic individuals with A\\u03b2 plaques in very early stages of disease onset [646, 647]. Considering failures in previous clinical trials, treatment at this stage may also be too late to show adequate efficacy, as neurodegenerative synaptic damage and neuronal loss are irreversible pathogenic events [648]. Treatments that can be administered at earlier stages of onset should be considered in future studies. Tau is also a critical therapeutic target in AD. Methylene blue and its derivatives have been tested for its ability to inhibit tau accumulation, but have yet to produce positive effects in clinical trials. A possible explanation for this may be derived from effects of methylene blue on increasing granular tau oligomers which may trigger neuronal death, despite concurrent effects in reducing tau fibril formation [649]. Moreover, use of tau kinase inhibitors such as the GSK-3 inhibitor Tideglusib to attenuate pathological tau hyperphosphorylation also showed little or no efficacy in Phase 2 trials, probably due to the critical role of GSK-3 in multifunctional signaling pathways [650, 651]. Despite these failures, hope lingers in targeting tau in the clinic, with trials currently testing the efficacy of tau-targeting monoclonal antibodies in clinical trials [652].

As mentioned above, there is a limited number of drugs for the treatment of AD. The pharmacological agents currently used for the therapy of the AD-associated dementia comprise three acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, donezepil, rivastigmine, and galantamine (Figure 2). The only non-AChE inhibitor drug, memantine, is a NMDA receptor antagonist (Figure 2). All these drugs are used in clinical practice for mild to severe dementia and provide a symptomatic relief alleviating to some extent the cognitive symptomathology. However, despite useful in improving the quality of life of the patients, they are not able to interrupt or delay the AD progression. This evidence has prompted the search for effective disease-modifying agents. Chemical structures of the approved drugs for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease treatment. To date, the majority of the disease-modifying strategies for AD have been based on A\\u03b2-focused approaches aimed at interfering with the A\\u03b2 production, deposition and clearance. In particular, some drugs targeting the A\\u03b2 peptide have been developed to control the APP proteolitic cleavage by \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases. Different BACE-1 inhibitors entered clinical trials because of the excellent results in preclinical studies. However, these trials proved unsuccessful due to the lack of effectiveness, as for the BACE-1 inhibitor Lanabecestat (Miranda et al., 2021), or because of a cognitive worsening in the patients, as in the case of Umibecestat (Neumann et al., 2018). Similarly, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors failed clinical trials because of many side effects (Miranda et al., 2021). As alternative approaches, the inhibition of the A\\u03b2 aggregation and the destabilization of pre-existing A\\u03b2 aggregates have also been considered. Two drugs able to inhibit the A\\u03b2 aggregation, tramiprosate and colostrinin, showed promising results in the early phases of clinical trials to fail successively in displaying any efficacy (Bilikiewicz and Gaus, 2004; Aisen et al., 2007). Beside the anti-aggregating molecules, other therapeutic strategies have included active or passive immunization against the A\\u03b2 peptide, consisting in the administration of A\\u03b2 antigens and anti-A\\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Unfortunately, although most of the A\\u03b2-targeted drugs tested in clinical trials unveiled promising results in reducing the A\\u03b2 burden, they did not prove a significant efficacy against the cognitive decline, hence raising the question of whether targeting solely the A\\u03b2 peptide could really impact on the AD pathogenesis. Since Tau neurofibrillary tangles are the other key pathological hallmark of AD, many pharmacological strategies have been directed to the Tau pathology, by addressing Tau hyperphosphorylation through Tau kinase inhibitors such as GSK-3\\u03b2 inhibitors, or its aggregation by means of anti-aggregating molecules (Long and Holtzman, 2019). Indeed, although it was postulated that the altered A\\u03b2 metabolism precedes the Tau-related pathology and neuronal degeneration, many reports showed that Tau hyperphosphorylation is a primary factor in AD independently on A\\u03b2, and that the\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Trambauer et al., 2019; Kakuda et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by the observation that increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following Aβ immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice suggest a beneficial inflammatory response (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition. Neurofilament light protein is also emerging as a biomarker of neurodegeneration, reflecting its translational value in both animal models and clinical settings (Bacioglu et al., 2016). These biomarkers can guide clinical decision-making and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, including neuroimaging techniques (such as PET scans detecting amyloid deposition) and CSF analysis for Aβ peptides, have significant clinical relevance. They assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and facilitate the identification of patients who may benefit from GSEC-targeted therapies. The use of these biomarkers in clinical trials can also help stratify patients based on their likelihood of response to GSEC modulators, thereby optimizing trial outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches in AD treatment. The correlation between CSF Aβ levels and brain deposition further emphasizes the role of these biomarkers in understanding GSEC activity and its implications for AD (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma secretase inhibitors could be used in combination with other therapeutic strategies targeting different aspects of AD pathology, such as tau protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Combining therapies could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing the disease and improving patient outcomes.\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

This result shows the direct link between inflammation and A\\u03b2 production via IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase in neurons158,212,213. IFITM3 modulates \\u03b3-secretase under inflammation in neurons and astrocytes and may contribute to aging and the pathogenesis of AD158.

The accumulation of amyloid leads to amyloid build-ups in the brain. Note that less than 14% of \\u03b3-secretase complexes are enzymatically active, while the rest are inactive.

To validate \\u03b3-secretase as an A\\u03b2 modifying drug, further studies on the regulation/modulation of \\u03b3-secretase by GSMs and transiently binding GSMPs are needed. In addition, the effects of GSMs and GSMPs on different substrate processing need to be elucidated.

High endogenous A\\u03b242 levels in synaptosomes from end-stage Alzheimer's brains can reach approximately 10 nM, inhibiting \\u03b3-secretase in certain cell types. This inhibition can alter signaling related to mechanisms like NOTCH signaling, which is essential for memory formation. Moreover, the interaction between A\\u03b2 and tau at synapses is implicated in synaptic dysfunction in AD, affecting neuroinflammation and potentially exacerbating tau protein aggregation.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

However, there isn't any proof right now that they're used in AD. In phase 2 clinical trials, etazolate (EHT 0202) is a \\u03b1-secretase stimulator that shifts APP processing to the non-amyloidogenic route(Landreth, 2007); Aisen et al., (Aisen et al., 2008). Oral medications for type 2 diabetes called thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, work as \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors by activating the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor.By boosting APP's ubiquitination, activation of these receptors can inhibit the production of \\u03b2-secretase and accelerate its destruction.Although it's unclear whether rosiglitazone can enter the human CNS, pioglitazone can cross the BBB (Henley et al., 2009). PPAR\\u03b3 agonists' therapeutic effects on AD may result from how they affect insulin activity, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammation. The neuropathology of AD appears to be facilitated by insulin resistance and peripheral hyperinsulinemia. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone improve peripheral insulin sensitivity while lowering insulin concentrations, which compete with A\\u03b2 for the insulin-degrading enzyme's concentration (Bolognesi et al., 2009); Aisen et al., (Aisen et al., 2008). A\\u03b2 secretase inhibitor called semagacestat (LY450139), which decreases CSF A\\u03b2 and seems to be well tolerated, is currently undergoing phase 3 clinical studies (Schneider et al., 2005). Other \\u03b3 secretase inhibitors, such as MK0752 in phase 1 and BMS-708163 in phase 2, which has a relatively low risk of Notch-related side effects, are in early clinical trialsAisen et al., (Aisen et al., 2008). The amyloid cascade theory views alterations in tau that result in NFT production as secondary processes, and as a result, this area has mostly been neglected in terms of treatments. The identification of mutations in the human tau gene, which led to the neurodegenerative conditions commonly known as frontotemporal dementia or tauopathies, altered perception.The notion that the alterations in tau found in AD may be responsible for cell death even if they are secondary to A\\u03b2 toxicity stems from the observation that even relatively minor changes in tau can trigger neuronal death (Schenk et al., 2006). Currently, there are two main strategies in this field (Schenk et al., 2006): Numerous studies on tau aggregation have demonstrated that nonphosphorylated tau can form filamentous aggregates, and they have used these systems to search for potential tau aggregation inhibitors. To promote tau aggregation, it include polyanions like heparin, RNA, or arachidonic acid(Schenk et al., 2006); (Davies and Koppel, 2009). There is little disagreement that tau is hyperphosphorylated in the elderly human and/or animal brain, on average it has an approximately 2\\u20133 moles of phosphate per mole of proteinwhile tau isolated from the Alzheimer brain contains 6\\u20138\\u2009moles of phosphate per mole of protein.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

However, antibody therapy may not be the optimal therapeutic modality for AD prevention, as we will discuss in the context of the earlier small molecules described as \\u201c\\u03b3-secretase modulators\\u201d (GSM). We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced. We propose the term \\u201c\\u03b3-secretase allosteric stabilizers\\u201d (GSAS) to distinguish these compounds from the rather heterogenous class of GSM. The GSAS represent, in theory, a precision medicine approach to the prevention of amyloid deposition, as they specifically target a discrete aspect in a complex cell biological signalling mechanism that initiates the pathological processes leading to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Trambauer et al., 2019; Kakuda et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by the observation that increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following Aβ immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice suggest a beneficial inflammatory response (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020).

The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Recently, A\\u03b243 generation and deposition were found to be increased in the brains of those carrying FAD mutations in PS1 [13, 14]. These studies raise the possibility that A\\u03b243 plays a pivotal role in the development of FAD. \\u03b3-Secretase generates each A\\u03b2 under two pathways. At first, A\\u03b249 and A\\u03b248 are cleaved from APP. A\\u03b249 is successively cleaved, mostly to A\\u03b240, via A\\u03b246 and A\\u03b243, while A\\u03b248 is similarly cleaved to A\\u03b238 via A\\u03b245 and A\\u03b242. Of note, the most abundant species, A\\u03b240, is derived not from A\\u03b242 but from A\\u03b243. Moreover, A\\u03b238 is derived mainly from A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 [18\\u201320]. These sequential A\\u03b2 generation mechanisms have been referred to as stepwise processing [18\\u201320]. We previously reported that (i) the levels of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 are proportional, and the levels of A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b240 are also proportional in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sporadic AD participants, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, and cognitively normal controls (NCs). The levels of A\\u03b2 concentration in the CSF might reflect lipid raft-associated \\u03b3-secretase activity from brain cortices [21, 22]; (ii) there is a correlation between the levels of deposited A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 in the cerebral parenchyma in the NCs, MCI, and sporadic AD brains [23]; and (iii) lipid raft-nonassociated \\u03b3-secretase activity in the AD brains increases the generation of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 from brain cortices, and these released A\\u03b2s into the extracellular space probably form senile plaques [23]. Thus, not only A\\u03b2 in the CSF but also its deposition in the brain parenchyma depends on \\u03b3-secretase activities. Based on these characteristics of \\u03b3-secretase in sporadic AD, we reassessed the mechanism of A\\u03b2 generation and \\u03b3-secretase activity in PS1 mutants using human CSF and in vitro \\u03b3-secretase assays. CSF samples from FAD participants showed low levels of A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 but not some A\\u03b243. Surprisingly, although lipid raft-associated \\u03b3-secretase activity, which was prepared from mutant PS1 stably expressing cells, showed decreased A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, and some A\\u03b242 generation in the in vitro \\u03b3-secretase assay, the level of A\\u03b243 was the same as the level of WT PS1. This \\u03b3-secretase activity was distinctly different from the alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity found in those with sporadic AD [21]. Liquid chromatography\\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that this altered A\\u03b243 generation was not only from A\\u03b246 but also from A\\u03b248 in the PS1 mutants, despite different stepwise processing pathways. The extent of switching A\\u03b243 generation might reflect FAD onset. The previously measured CSF samples of participants with sporadic AD, MCI, and cognitively NCs were described previously [21]. Briefly, we included 24 participants with AD (mild-to-moderate AD; 50\\u201386 years old), 19 participants with MCI (57\\u201382 years old), and 21 cognitively NC participants (61\\u201389 years old).

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular -homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) (1). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (5, 6), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatment with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (7), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (8\\u201312). The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Trambauer et al., 2019; Kakuda et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by the observation that increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following Aβ immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice suggest a beneficial inflammatory response (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition.

A\\u03b2 forms soluble oligomers that influence synaptic plasticity or exert neurotoxicity [18], and AICD may regulate nuclear functions [19]. APP metabolism is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alcs are also subject to proteolytic cleavage by a combination of \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases, yielding secreted p3-Alc and the intracellular domain fragment Alc ICD [11,20,21]. As with A\\u03b2, secreted p3-Alc is detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and later in blood. In p3-Alc\\u03b2, the major p3-Alc\\u03b237 and minor p3-Alc\\u03b240 molecules are present in CSF [21,22]. These are generated by an alternative \\u03b3-secretase cleavage of Alc\\u03b2 CTF. Thus, p3-Alc\\u03b240 possesses three more C-terminal amino acids than p3-Alc\\u03b237 [21]. Changes in the activity of \\u03b3-secretase can alter the final cleavage site of Alcs (i.e. the \\u03b3-site) as has been observed for the APP [21,23]. This alteration is detectable as an endophenotype of p3-Alc\\u03b1 with C-terminal variants in patients with AD [22] and in cells treated with compounds that modulate \\u03b3-secretase activity [24,25]. These lines of evidence suggest that the function and metabolism of Alcs are also closely involved in AD pathobiology. In this study, we validated new specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (sELISA) systems to specifically quantify p3-Alc\\u03b237 and p3-Alc\\u03b240 and quantified these peptides in human and monkey CSF, as investigated for p3-Alc\\u03b1 in blood and CSF of patients with AD [[26], [27], [28]]. The results may provide important insight into the alteration of p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels in AD pathogenesis. Human p3-Alc\\u03b237 and p3-Alc\\u03b240 peptides include the sequence from Val813 to Thr849 and to Ilu852 of Alc\\u03b2, respectively [21]. The polyclonal rabbit pan-p3-Alc\\u03b2 antibody #826 was raised to Cys plus the N-terminal sequence between Val813 and His821 of p3-Alc\\u03b2. This antibody reacts to all p3-Alc\\u03b2 species, but not p3-Alc\\u03b1 and p3-Alc\\u03b3 peptides. In sELISA, Fab' fragments of affinity-purified IgG of #826 were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and used to detect the captured p3-Alc\\u03b2 with tetramethylbenzidine colorimetrically at OD450 [27]. The polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised against an antigen peptide composed of Cys plus the sequence between positions 841and 849, and the monoclonal mouse antibody was raised against a peptide composed of Cys plus the sequence between positions 844 and 853. One antibody showing specific reactivity to p3-Alc\\u03b237 was designed 37-specific, wheas the another antibody showing specificity to p3-Alc\\u03b240 was designed 40-specific. These antibodies were affinity purified with respective antigen columns. A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 were quantified with a commercial sELISA (IBL, Fujioka, Japan, for nonhuman materials and cohort 2). Cohort 3 was analyzed for A\\u03b242, tau and/or ptau181 twice with different procedures, which were designed as cohort 3a and 3b.

For the first time, both Tau and pTau181 can be measured in plasma to predict brain Tau load and neurodegeneration, for monitoring the efficacy of \\u03b2- or \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors/modulators in clinical trials. Existing \\u03b2-/\\u03b3-secretase inhibitors/modulators can then be tested in sub-cohorts selected by AT(N) biomarker. One plausible explanation for negative clinical results is that BACE1 inhibitors and GSIs/GSMs were given too late, during the irreversible phase of the disease (MCI/prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD), and patients need to be treated at earlier stage of AD to prevent neurodegeneration. The phase III trial of BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat by Merck in patients with prodromal AD (MCI) was discontinued in 2018, similar to the phase II/III trial of atabecestat by Janssen. In addition, side effects and toxicity account for a number of failed trials, such as the inhibition of Notch signaling by GSIs. Recent studies on BACE1 knockout mice suggested that BACE1 inhibitors may disrupt the axonal organization in the hippocampus, and impair synaptic plasticity, leading to defects in learning and memory (Ou-Yang et al., 2018; Lombardo et al., 2019). Inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase cleavage can lead to the accumulation of C99 fragment (Lauritzen et al., 2019a), which was correlated to the acceleration of early neurodegenerative process in AD (Lauritzen et al., 2012; Lauritzen et al., 2019b). An obstacle for the development of selective GSMs is the lack of information about the structural characteristics of \\u03b3-secretase-substrate complex. Recent cryo-EM structure of \\u03b3-secretase bound to the C83 fragment and Notch substrate (Yang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019) started to fill this crucial knowledge gap. An \\u03b1-helical to \\u03b2-strand transition was observed at the C-terminal of APPTM, forming an anti-parallel, intermolecular \\u03b2-sheet with two induced \\u03b2-strands from presenilin (Figure 8). The unwinding of C-terminal transmembrane helix exposes the initial \\u03b5-cleavage sites (T48, L49) to interact with \\u03b3-secretase (Zhou et al., 2019). These are in agreement with earlier Raman and NMR spectroscopic studies carried out on APPTM and PSHs in solution, which showed that substrate binding is coupled with helical unwinding to prime the substrate for peptide bond hydrolysis (Brown et al., 2018; Clemente et al., 2018). The unwinding model of \\u03b3-secretase-APP interaction. This unwinding model of the substrate in \\u03b3-secretase-APP interaction suggests that targeting APP, especially the C-terminal of APPTM, could be a new strategy in selective amyloid reduction. A substrate-specific inhibitor is not expected to affect the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage of other physiological substrates, the assembly of the \\u03b3-secretase complex, or any presenilin function (Saura et al., 2004; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2012; Barthet et al., 2013), thereby sparing the side effects associated with broad-spectrum \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors. A novel compound C1 was found to interact with the C-terminal juxtamembrane lysines of APP and inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase production of A\\u03b2 both in vitro and in cell (Zhao et al., 2020).

A similar approach has been used in trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators. Some trials found a decrease in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 (Bateman et al. 2009; Tong et al. 2012; Coric et al. 2015) and A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Tong et al. 2012), and an increase in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201314, A\\u03b21\\u201315 and A\\u03b21\\u201316 (Portelius et al. 2010; Portelius, Fortea, et al. 2012; Portelius, Zetterberg, et al. 2012). Other studies, however, did not find significant differences in levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342 or A\\u03b21\\u201340 compared to a placebo group (Siemers et al. 2006; Galasko et al. 2007; Fleisher et al. 2008; Portelius, Zetterberg, et al. 2012; Doody et al. 2013; Imbimbo et al. 2013; Doody et al. 2015). Peptidomic approaches could also be useful in the identification of biomarkers to verify target engagement. The analysis of the CSF peptidome by liquid chromatography and mass MS prior to and following a single dose of the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat led (Holtta et al. 2016) to the identification of 11 peptides that were altered following pharmaceutical intervention. The effects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy have also been evaluated using CSF biomarkers, although data are more difficult to interpret than in the studies of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds, AN1792 and CAD-106, were able to show changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers (Gilman et al. 2005; Winblad et al. 2012). Likewise, treatment with the monoclonal antibody bapineuzumab did not change amyloid marker levels in CSF (Blennow et al. 2012). In contrast, patients treated with solanezumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target soluble A\\u03b2, did show an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF (Siemers et al. 2010; Farlow et al. 2012; Doody et al. 2014). Although the primary clinical outcome was not achieved in that study, the authors hypothesised that the changes observed in CSF levels could indicate a shift of A\\u03b2 from the CNS to the periphery or perhaps a mobilisation between compartments reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2 (Farlow et al. 2012; Doody et al. 2014). Two phase I dose-escalation studies with ponezumab, another monoclonal antibody, also determined post-treatment CSF A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels but showed contradictory results (Landen et al. 2013; Miyoshi et al. 2013).

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

Because cohort 3 samples were examined twice using different procedures, results are shown as cohort 3a and cohort 3b, respectively, in Supplementary Table\\u00a02. CSF A\\u03b242 levels were significantly lower in patients with AD and MCI than those in controls, in all three cohorts. CSF levels of total tau in cohort 1 and cohort 3a were significantly higher in patients with AD than those in controls. Likewise, tau levels tended to be elevated in patients with MCI. Levels of ptau were also higher in patients with AD and/or MCI than those in controls in cohort 2 and cohort 3b. Taken together, the p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels were largely lower in patients with AD than those in age-matched control subjects, there were also significantly lower A\\u03b242 levels and higher tau and ptau levels in CSF, which are characteristic features of AD subjects. To examine whether the change of p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels in the CSF of patients with AD is due to the alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity, we quantified the p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels of subjects who carry PSEN1 gene mutations (Fig.\\u00a04C). Given the limited amounts and numbers of samples, we only examined p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels. p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels in the CSF of PSEN1 gene mutation carriers (n\\u00a0=\\u00a09) (H163R, S169L, Q222H, M233T, S290C) were compared with p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels in the CSF of noncarrier subjects from the same families (n\\u00a0=\\u00a016), as well as subjects who carry APP gene mutations (n\\u00a0=\\u00a07) (E963Q and V717L) (Fig.\\u00a04C). Although it is difficult to compare these in same age subjects, and A\\u03b2 levels were not measured, the CSF from PSEN1 gene mutation carriers showed significantly reduced p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels compared with the CSF from the noncarrier subjects. A summary of study subject information is shown (Supplementary Table\\u00a03). Interestingly, seven of nine carrier subjects remained in a nondemented state (CDR 0), suggesting that the decrease in the CSF p3-Alc\\u03b237 level begins at a prodromal stage before MCI. The results suggest that alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity by disease-causative mutations of the PSEN1 gene also induce further the reduction in p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels in the CSF of individuals in\\u00a0vivo along with the decrease of Alc\\u03b2 expression.

However, antibody therapy may not be the optimal therapeutic modality for AD prevention, as we will discuss in the context of the earlier small molecules described as \\u201c\\u03b3-secretase modulators\\u201d (GSM). We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced. We propose the term \\u201c\\u03b3-secretase allosteric stabilizers\\u201d (GSAS) to distinguish these compounds from the rather heterogenous class of GSM. The GSAS represent, in theory, a precision medicine approach to the prevention of amyloid deposition, as they specifically target a discrete aspect in a complex cell biological signalling mechanism that initiates the pathological processes leading to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

Importantly, these compounds do not accelerate the production of the potentially toxic product BACE1-C-terminal fragment (C99) (Toyn et al., 2016). In all species, research suggests that \\u03b3-secretase modulator treatment decrease A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 levels while increasing A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b237 by a corresponding amount. Therefore, the mechanism of action of \\u03b3-secretase modulators may translate well across species, validating its therapeutic strategy for utility in AD (Toyn et al., 2016). Other translational research across species has shown increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following A\\u03b2 immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007). Thereby, translation of inflammatory mechanisms and their peripheral markers may benefit from investigation of changes in microglial markers. However, when interpreting and comparing immune markers from mice caution is warranted, as recent evidence suggests that these markers do not translate well to human inflammatory diseases (Seok et al., 2013). Moreover, increased levels of isoprostanes have been shown in Tg2576 mice prior to plaque formation (Pratico et al., 2001), suggesting isoprostane levels may be useful as a predictive biomarker. Neurofilament light in bodily fluid constitutes a biomarker of neurodegeneration reflecting its translational value in system models and in clinical settings (Bacioglu et al., 2016). The earliest (current) detectable A\\u03b2 deposition in humans is the formation of diffuse plaques, whereas in the brain of Tg2576 mice diffuse plaques are not observed until 12 months of age, which is 4 months after biochemically detectable alterations of A\\u03b2 (Kawarabayashi et al., 2001). The most common observation in AD patients is minor amounts of A\\u03b240 deposited in the brain, whereas in 33% of patients great amounts of this A\\u03b2 variant are detected. Intriguingly, this latter group of patients also display substantial amyloid angiopathy (amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain) (Gravina et al., 1995). Similarly, the Tg2576 mouse model displays marked angiopathy and the deposition of a large amount of A\\u03b240 (Gravina et al., 1995). Generally CSF A\\u03b240 levels are much higher in patients compared to mice, while brain concentrations are similar (Karelina et al., 2017). In terms of plasma concentrations of A\\u03b240, this is highly similar between patients and mice, and therefore the greater A\\u03b240 concentrations observed in human CSF may likely reflect a higher brain production of the peptide (Karelina et al., 2017). In terms of the similarity between system models and patients, and specifically transgenic mice and human patients, mice and humans share virtually the same set of genes. Almost every gene found in mice or humans has been observed in a closely related form in the other. To look directly at differences along the AD disease cascade, we compare pathological events between the 3xTg AD mouse model and sporadic AD patients (Figure 4). The 3xTg AD mouse model develops amyloid and tau pathology, including amyloid plaques and NFTs (Oddo et al., 2003). At 3 months of age these mice have developed cognitive impairment (Oddo et al., 2003), whereas at approximately \",\n",

Recent studies support the notion that accumulation of the A\\u03b2 peptide arises from an imbalance in the production and clearance of A\\u03b2 and that the ability to clear A\\u03b2 diminishes with age (Wildsmith et al., 2013). An attractive early biomarker for AD is CSF A\\u03b242, given that both CSF t-tau and p-tau changes occur at a later time point in the disease process closer to clinically detectable dementia (Buchhave et al., 2012). Furthermore, measurement of the CSF A\\u03b242:A\\u03b240 ratio is superior to A\\u03b242 alone when distinguishing between MCI patients who progress and those that do not progress to AD dementia (Hansson et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2019). When comparing A\\u03b2 fluid biomarkers and imaging biomarkers, studies have shown that CSF A\\u03b242 can detect amyloid pathology earlier than amyloid PET imaging (Figure 3; Palmqvist et al., 2016). There appears to be a lack of consensus regarding CSF A\\u03b2 concentrations in AD patients. For instance, researchers have found that CSF A\\u03b242 concentrations increase (Nakamura et al., 1994; Bouwman et al., 2007), decrease (Kanai et al., 1998; Tapiola et al., 2000; Wahlund and Blennow, 2003; Mollenhauer et al., 2005; de Leon et al., 2006; Beckett et al., 2010), or experience no significant change (Andreasen et al., 1998, 1999a; Hoglund et al., 2005; Andersson et al., 2008; Brys et al., 2009; Stomrud et al., 2010) during the disease. The prevailing explanation for a reduced amount of A\\u03b2 in later stages of AD is that as the pathology progresses, more A\\u03b2, especially A\\u03b242, aggregates into plaques in the brain, which effectively means that less A\\u03b2 can diffuse from the brain to the CSF. Another explanation may be that A\\u03b2 first accumulates intracellularly, and neurodegeneration releases A\\u03b2 in the extracellular compartment, increasing CSF A\\u03b2 levels, and subsequently accumulates onto neuronal surfaces and in synapses as it clears away from the CSF. As neurodegeneration occurs, less A\\u03b2 is produced and therefore smaller amounts will accumulate in the CSF and subsequently in the brain, where A\\u03b2 will reach plateau levels. Alternatively, reduced CSF A\\u03b242 might follow neuronal dysfunction, which results in decreased metabolism of APP and A\\u03b2. It is important to note that this is unlikely in transgenic mice, as A\\u03b242 levels in the CSF decline, while its levels in the brain keep rising. Also, when above a certain level, parts of CSF A\\u03b242 may aggregate into a large assembly that antibodies of currently used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits cannot capture (Pitschke et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2004). These seemingly disparate findings regarding CSF A\\u03b2 concentrations may therefore reflect different timepoints of the disease progression. With regard to studies using A\\u03b2 as a fluid biomarker for AD, studies have shown that concentrations of CSF A\\u03b242 increased between 5 and 7 months of age, but not between 8 and 13 months of age in an APP/PS1 mouse model (Liu et al., 2004). This was despite a rapid increase in brain levels of A\\u03b242 (Liu et al.,\",\n",

These results were confirmed in another cohort, which included 276 subjects with SCD, who were dichotomized according to amyloid-PET results, and found that the levels of A\\u03b242 and the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio were also reduced in amyloid-positive individuals, and that there was a significant negative association between global/regional amyloid deposition and plasma A\\u03b242. The accuracy of using the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio to predict PET status reached about 0.80 [AUC] [91]. In a relatively small sample (n=95), researchers observed that the differences in plasma A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio between amyloid positive and negative groups were only found in SCD subjects but not in non-SCD healthy controls [92], which needs to be further verified. Nakamura and colleagues established the important position of IP-MS and studied the ability of A\\u03b2 precursor protein669-711/A\\u03b242 ratio, A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio, and their composites to predict individual brain amyloid status as determined by amyloid-PET imaging, and found that all test indicators were significantly correlated with both PET burden and CSF A\\u03b242 levels in two independent cohorts with mixed cognitive levels. This demonstrates that the three different types of A\\u03b2-related biomarkers (plasma, CSF, and PET) are highly correlated with each other, convincingly suggesting the potential utility of plasma biomarkers by using this method [81, 83]. Recently, these researchers further indicated that applying the composite score to cognitively healthy individuals is also recommendable [93], after dividing these subjects into two groups based on the blood index, there appeared statistical differences in PET-based amyloid positive rates and amyloid burdens between groups, and both continuous and categorical measures of the index were significantly related to decline in episodic memory and executive function. Using the same method, another research group reported that cognitively healthy individuals with a positive amyloid-PET had a lower plasma A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio compared to the negative individuals. More importantly, the plasma ratio was significantly correlated with brain amyloidosis that was determined by PET or CSF A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 and could predict PET status with an accuracy of 0.88 [AUC].

Panelists agreed on the clinical workspace of the workflow (specialist outpatient service), the stage of application (prodromal and mild dementia), and the patient age window (biomarker use strongly encouraged below 70 years and of limited usefulness over age 85). The workflow is patient-centered and features three levels of assessment (W): W1 defines eleven clinical profiles based on integrated results of neuropsychology, MRI atrophy patterns, and blood tests; W2 describes the first-line biomarkers according to W1 versus clinical suspicion; and W3 suggests the second-line biomarkers when the results of first-line biomarkers are inconsistent with the diagnostic hypothesis, uninformative or inconclusive. More specifically, CSF biomarkers are first-line in the suspect of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) and when inconsistent neuropsychological and MRI findings hinder a clear diagnostic hypothesis; dopamine SPECT/PET for those leading to suspect Lewy body spectrum. FDG-PET is first-line for the clinical profiles leading to suspect frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor tauopathies and is followed by CSF biomarkers in the case of atypical metabolic patterns, when an underlying AD etiology is conceivable. None of these biomarkers is indicated when clinical profiles suggest vascular cognitive impairment or other neurological disorders. Conclusions: The workflow will promote consistency in diagnosing neurocognitive disorders across countries and rational use of resources. The initiative has some limitations, mainly linked to the Delphi procedure (e.g., kick-off questions were driven by the moderators, answers are driven by the Delphi panel composition, a subtle phrasing of the questions may drive answers, and 70% threshold for convergence is conventional).

GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",

Other studies, however, did not find significant differences in levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342 or A\\u03b21\\u201340 compared to a placebo group (Siemers et al. 2006; Galasko et al. 2007; Fleisher et al. 2008; Portelius, Zetterberg, et al. 2012; Doody et al. 2013; Imbimbo et al. 2013; Doody et al. 2015). Peptidomic approaches could also be useful in the identification of biomarkers to verify target engagement. The analysis of the CSF peptidome by liquid chromatography and mass MS prior to and following a single dose of the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat led (Holtta et al. 2016) to the identification of 11 peptides that were altered following pharmaceutical intervention. The effects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy have also been evaluated using CSF biomarkers, although data are more difficult to interpret than in the studies of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds, AN1792 and CAD-106, were able to show changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers (Gilman et al. 2005; Winblad et al. 2012). Likewise, treatment with the monoclonal antibody bapineuzumab did not change amyloid marker levels in CSF (Blennow et al. 2012). In contrast, patients treated with solanezumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody designed to target soluble A\\u03b2, did show an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF (Siemers et al. 2010; Farlow et al. 2012; Doody et al. 2014).

Emerging data also support a temporal delay, where reductions in CSF A\\u03b242 are detectable prior to amyloid positivity by PET (Bateman et al. 2012; Palmqvist et al. 2016; Vlassenko et al. 2016). When bio-markers are measured early in the disease, this temporal lag would contribute to a discordance. Therefore, while amyloid PET and CSF A\\u03b242 are often considered interchangeable, CSF A\\u03b242 (and/or the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio) likely detects the earliest changes in A\\u03b2 pathology, but CSF A\\u03b242 levels then plateau during early symptomatic stages. Increases in amyloid PET become detectable after initial changes in CSF, but PET measures continue to increase later into the course of the disease. While there is an established body of work examining A\\u03b2 with both CSF and PET, only recently have similar analyses been possible for Tau. Initial studies have shown positive correlations between CSF Tau and pTau and PET measures of tauopathy (Chhatwal et al. 2016; Gordon, Friedrichsen, et al. 2016). However, such work is very preliminary. Additional studies are needed to confirm both the strength and temporal associations between the two modalities and better characterise the exact relationship between Tau markers in CSF and PET. As reviewed and stressed on several occasions in this paper, biomarker research conducted in the last decades has shifted AD conceptualisation from a clinical-pathological entity to a clinical-biological one and AD is now defined as a pathological continuum that can be arbitrarily divided in three stages: pre-clinical (abnormal biomarkers and no or only subtle cognitive impairment), MCI or prodromal AD (abnormal pathophysiological biomarkers and episodic memory impairment) and dementia (abnormal biomarkers and clear cognitive and functional impairment). By enabling the assessment of AD pathophysiology in vivo and independently of dementia, biomarkers have not only produced a major shift in both AD conceptualisation but also in its diagnosis, as well as playing an important role in drug development (Cummings 2011). The possibility of assessing relevant AD pathophysiology in living persons through biomarkers has resulted in a change in guidelines and diagnostic criteria for AD. Two sets of criteria recently published will be discussed in more detail in this paper; one by the IWG that has recently been revised (IWG-2 (Dubois et al. 2014)) and the other by working groups assembled by the NIA and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association in the US (McKhann et al. 2011). In short, although both groups define AD as a pathological continuum, the NIA-AA defines different clinical syndromes and the pre-clinical stage, which are diagnosed with their own specific algorithm. The NIA-AA divided the clinical phase of AD into MCI and AD dementia but employ different approaches to the diagnosis in each stage of the illness. MCI due to AD (Albert et al. 2011). The clinical criteria for MCI are the same as those previously published. The NIA-AA criteria stratify the diagnosis of MCI with biomarkers to determine the likelihood that the syndrome is due to AD.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

Because CSF A\\u03b242 levels are lower in patients with AD because of A\\u03b242 aggregation and precipitation in the brain [36], we measured A\\u03b242 levels in the same 3 cohort samples (Supplementary Table\\u00a02). Because cohort 3 samples were examined twice using different procedures, results are shown as cohort 3a and cohort 3b, respectively, in Supplementary Table\\u00a02. CSF A\\u03b242 levels were significantly lower in patients with AD and MCI than those in controls, in all three cohorts. CSF levels of total tau in cohort 1 and cohort 3a were significantly higher in patients with AD than those in controls. Likewise, tau levels tended to be elevated in patients with MCI. Levels of ptau were also higher in patients with AD and/or MCI than those in controls in cohort 2 and cohort 3b. Taken together, the p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels were largely lower in patients with AD than those in age-matched control subjects, there were also significantly lower A\\u03b242 levels and higher tau and ptau levels in CSF, which are characteristic features of AD subjects. To examine whether the change of p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels in the CSF of patients with AD is due to the alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity, we quantified the p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels of subjects who carry PSEN1 gene mutations (Fig.\\u00a04C). Given the limited amounts and numbers of samples, we only examined p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels. p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels in the CSF of PSEN1 gene mutation carriers (n\\u00a0=\\u00a09) (H163R, S169L, Q222H, M233T, S290C) were compared with p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels in the CSF of noncarrier subjects from the same families (n\\u00a0=\\u00a016), as well as subjects who carry APP gene mutations (n\\u00a0=\\u00a07) (E963Q and V717L) (Fig.\\u00a04C). Although it is difficult to compare these in same age subjects, and A\\u03b2 levels were not measured, the CSF from PSEN1 gene mutation carriers showed significantly reduced p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels compared with the CSF from the noncarrier subjects. A summary of study subject information is shown (Supplementary Table\\u00a03). Interestingly, seven of nine carrier subjects remained in a nondemented state (CDR 0), suggesting that the decrease in the CSF p3-Alc\\u03b237 level begins at a prodromal stage before MCI. The results suggest that alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity by disease-causative mutations of the PSEN1 gene also induce further the reduction in p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels in the CSF of individuals in\\u00a0vivo along with the decrease of Alc\\u03b2 expression. The decrease in p3-Alc\\u03b2 in the CSF of aged subjects may be due to a reduction of Alc\\u03b2 protein expression in the brain (Figs. 2 and 3). However, the alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity is also suggested to decrease p3-Alc\\u03b237 (Fig.\\u00a04C).

Recent studies support the notion that accumulation of the A\\u03b2 peptide arises from an imbalance in the production and clearance of A\\u03b2 and that the ability to clear A\\u03b2 diminishes with age (Wildsmith et al., 2013). An attractive early biomarker for AD is CSF A\\u03b242, given that both CSF t-tau and p-tau changes occur at a later time point in the disease process closer to clinically detectable dementia (Buchhave et al., 2012). Furthermore, measurement of the CSF A\\u03b242:A\\u03b240 ratio is superior to A\\u03b242 alone when distinguishing between MCI patients who progress and those that do not progress to AD dementia (Hansson et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2019). When comparing A\\u03b2 fluid biomarkers and imaging biomarkers, studies have shown that CSF A\\u03b242 can detect amyloid pathology earlier than amyloid PET imaging (Figure 3; Palmqvist et al., 2016). There appears to be a lack of consensus regarding CSF A\\u03b2 concentrations in AD patients. For instance, researchers have found that CSF A\\u03b242 concentrations increase (Nakamura et al., 1994; Bouwman et al., 2007), decrease (Kanai et al., 1998; Tapiola et al., 2000; Wahlund and Blennow, 2003; Mollenhauer et al., 2005; de Leon et al., 2006; Beckett et al., 2010), or experience no significant change (Andreasen et al., 1998, 1999a; Hoglund et al., 2005; Andersson et al., 2008; Brys et al., 2009; Stomrud et al., 2010) during the disease. The prevailing explanation for a reduced amount of A\\u03b2 in later stages of AD is that as the pathology progresses, more A\\u03b2, especially A\\u03b242, aggregates into plaques in the brain, which effectively means that less A\\u03b2 can diffuse from the brain to the CSF. Another explanation may be that A\\u03b2 first accumulates intracellularly, and neurodegeneration releases A\\u03b2 in the extracellular compartment, increasing CSF A\\u03b2 levels, and subsequently accumulates onto neuronal surfaces and in synapses as it clears away from the CSF. As neurodegeneration occurs, less A\\u03b2 is produced and therefore smaller amounts will accumulate in the CSF and subsequently in the brain, where A\\u03b2 will reach plateau levels. Alternatively, reduced CSF A\\u03b242 might follow neuronal dysfunction, which results in decreased metabolism of APP and A\\u03b2. It is important to note that this is unlikely in transgenic mice, as A\\u03b242 levels in the CSF decline, while its levels in the brain keep rising. Also, when above a certain level, parts of CSF A\\u03b242 may aggregate into a large assembly that antibodies of currently used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits cannot capture (Pitschke et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2004). These seemingly disparate findings regarding CSF A\\u03b2 concentrations may therefore reflect different timepoints of the disease progression. With regard to studies using A\\u03b2 as a fluid biomarker for AD, studies have shown that concentrations of CSF A\\u03b242 increased between 5 and 7 months of age, but not between 8 and 13 months of age in an APP/PS1 mouse model (Liu et al., 2004). This was despite a rapid increase in brain levels of A\\u03b242 (Liu et al.,\",\n",

We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced.

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

These results were confirmed in another cohort, which included 276 subjects with SCD, who were dichotomized according to amyloid-PET results, and found that the levels of A\\u03b242 and the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio were also reduced in amyloid-positive individuals, and that there was a significant negative association between global/regional amyloid deposition and plasma A\\u03b242. The accuracy of using the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio to predict PET status reached about 0.80 [AUC] [91]. In a relatively small sample (n=95), researchers observed that the differences in plasma A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio between amyloid positive and negative groups were only found in SCD subjects but not in non-SCD healthy controls [92], which needs to be further verified.

This demonstrates that the three different types of A\\u03b2-related biomarkers (plasma, CSF, and PET) are highly correlated with each other, convincingly suggesting the potential utility of plasma biomarkers by using this method [81, 83]. Recently, these researchers further indicated that applying the composite score to cognitively healthy individuals is also recommendable [93], after dividing these subjects into two groups based on the blood index, there appeared statistical differences in PET-based amyloid positive rates and amyloid burdens between groups, and both continuous and categorical measures of the index were significantly related to decline in episodic memory and executive function.

The workflow outlined indicates that plasma biomarkers, including A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios, may be utilized alongside neuropsychological assessments when aiming for early diagnosis.

Panelists agreed on the clinical workspace of the workflow (specialist outpatient service), the stage of application (prodromal and mild dementia), and the patient age window (biomarker use strongly encouraged below 70 years and of limited usefulness over age 85). The workflow is patient-centered and features three levels of assessment (W): W1 defines eleven clinical profiles based on integrated results of neuropsychology, MRI atrophy patterns, and blood tests; W2 describes the first-line biomarkers according to W1 versus clinical suspicion; and W3 suggests the second-line biomarkers when the results of first-line biomarkers are inconsistent with the diagnostic hypothesis, uninformative or inconclusive. More specifically, CSF biomarkers are first-line in the suspect of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) and when inconsistent neuropsychological and MRI findings hinder a clear diagnostic hypothesis; dopamine SPECT/PET for those leading to suspect Lewy body spectrum. FDG-PET is first-line for the clinical profiles leading to suspect frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor tauopathies and is followed by CSF biomarkers in the case of atypical metabolic patterns, when an underlying AD etiology is conceivable. None of these biomarkers is indicated when clinical profiles suggest vascular cognitive impairment or other neurological disorders. Conclusions: The workflow will promote consistency in diagnosing neurocognitive disorders across countries and rational use of resources. The initiative has some limitations, mainly linked to the Delphi procedure (e.g., kick-off questions were driven by the moderators, answers are driven by the Delphi panel composition, a subtle phrasing of the questions may drive answers, and 70% threshold for convergence is conventional). However, the diagnostic workflow will be able to help clinicians achieve an early and sustainable etiological diagnosis and enable the use of disease-modifying drugs as soon as they become available.

Background: Detecting amyloid pathologies has become increasingly important for selecting patients for clinical trials and diagnosing Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) in clinical practice. Although amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid concentration of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b240 reflect the presence of amyloid pathologies, these methods are expensive and/or invasive. To overcome these limitations, studies have focused on the use of blood-based biomarkers. Objectives: We aimed to determine the efficacy of combining plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240, neurofilament light (NfL) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes in detecting positive amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) in a prospective cohort of individuals with and without AD.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Hata et al., 2019; Jing et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by studies showing that GSEC inhibition can lead to altered Aβ peptide profiles without exacerbating the production of toxic fragments like C99 (Lauritzen et al., 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition. Neurofilament light protein is also emerging as a biomarker of neurodegeneration, reflecting its translational value in both animal models and clinical settings (Bacioglu et al., 2016). These biomarkers can guide clinical decision-making and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, including neuroimaging techniques (such as PET scans detecting amyloid deposition) and CSF analysis for Aβ peptides, have significant clinical relevance. They assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and facilitate the identification of patients who may benefit from GSEC-targeted therapies. The use of these biomarkers in clinical trials can also help stratify patients based on their likelihood of response to GSEC modulators, thereby optimizing trial outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches in AD treatment.

A\\u03b2 forms soluble oligomers that influence synaptic plasticity or exert neurotoxicity [18], and AICD may regulate nuclear functions [19]. APP metabolism is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alcs are also subject to proteolytic cleavage by a combination of \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases, yielding secreted p3-Alc and the intracellular domain fragment Alc ICD [11,20,21]. As with A\\u03b2, secreted p3-Alc is detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and later in blood. In p3-Alc\\u03b2, the major p3-Alc\\u03b237 and minor p3-Alc\\u03b240 molecules are present in CSF [21,22]. These are generated by an alternative \\u03b3-secretase cleavage of Alc\\u03b2 CTF. Thus, p3-Alc\\u03b240 possesses three more C-terminal amino acids than p3-Alc\\u03b237 [21]. Changes in the activity of \\u03b3-secretase can alter the final cleavage site of Alcs (i.e. the \\u03b3-site) as has been observed for the APP [21,23]. This alteration is detectable as an endophenotype of p3-Alc\\u03b1 with C-terminal variants in patients with AD [22] and in cells treated with compounds that modulate \\u03b3-secretase activity [24,25]. These lines of evidence suggest that the function and metabolism of Alcs are also closely involved in AD pathobiology. In this study, we validated new specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (sELISA) systems to specifically quantify p3-Alc\\u03b237 and p3-Alc\\u03b240 and quantified these peptides in human and monkey CSF, as investigated for p3-Alc\\u03b1 in blood and CSF of patients with AD [[26], [27], [28]]. The results may provide important insight into the alteration of p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels in AD pathogenesis. Human p3-Alc\\u03b237 and p3-Alc\\u03b240 peptides include the sequence from Val813 to Thr849 and to Ilu852 of Alc\\u03b2, respectively [21]. The polyclonal rabbit pan-p3-Alc\\u03b2 antibody #826 was raised to Cys plus the N-terminal sequence between Val813 and His821 of p3-Alc\\u03b2. This antibody reacts to all p3-Alc\\u03b2 species, but not p3-Alc\\u03b1 and p3-Alc\\u03b3 peptides. In sELISA, Fab' fragments of affinity-purified IgG of #826 were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and used to detect the captured p3-Alc\\u03b2 with tetramethylbenzidine colorimetrically at OD450 [27]. The polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised against an antigen peptide composed of Cys plus the sequence between positions 841and 849, and the monoclonal mouse antibody was raised against a peptide composed of Cys plus the sequence between positions 844 and 853. One antibody showing specific reactivity to p3-Alc\\u03b237 was designed 37-specific, wheas the another antibody showing specificity to p3-Alc\\u03b240 was designed 40-specific.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

For the first time, both Tau and pTau181 can be measured in plasma to predict brain Tau load and neurodegeneration, for monitoring the efficacy of \\u03b2- or \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors/modulators in clinical trials. Existing \\u03b2-/\\u03b3-secretase inhibitors/modulators can then be tested in sub-cohorts selected by AT(N) biomarker. One plausible explanation for negative clinical results is that BACE1 inhibitors and GSIs/GSMs were given too late, during the irreversible phase of the disease (MCI/prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD), and patients need to be treated at earlier stage of AD to prevent neurodegeneration. The phase III trial of BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat by Merck in patients with prodromal AD (MCI) was discontinued in 2018, similar to the phase II/III trial of atabecestat by Janssen. In addition, side effects and toxicity account for a number of failed trials, such as the inhibition of Notch signaling by GSIs. Recent studies on BACE1 knockout mice suggested that BACE1 inhibitors may disrupt the axonal organization in the hippocampus, and impair synaptic plasticity, leading to defects in learning and memory (Ou-Yang et al., 2018; Lombardo et al., 2019). Inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase cleavage can lead to the accumulation of C99 fragment (Lauritzen et al., 2019a), which was correlated to the acceleration of early neurodegenerative process in AD (Lauritzen et al., 2012; Lauritzen et al., 2019b). An obstacle for the development of selective GSMs is the lack of information about the structural characteristics of \\u03b3-secretase-substrate complex. Recent cryo-EM structure of \\u03b3-secretase bound to the C83 fragment and Notch substrate (Yang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019) started to fill this crucial knowledge gap. An \\u03b1-helical to \\u03b2-strand transition was observed at the C-terminal of APPTM, forming an anti-parallel, intermolecular \\u03b2-sheet with two induced \\u03b2-strands from presenilin (Figure 8). The unwinding of C-terminal transmembrane helix exposes the initial \\u03b5-cleavage sites (T48, L49) to interact with \\u03b3-secretase (Zhou et al., 2019). These are in agreement with earlier Raman and NMR spectroscopic studies carried out on APPTM and PSHs in solution, which showed that substrate binding is coupled with helical unwinding to prime the substrate for peptide bond hydrolysis (Brown et al., 2018; Clemente et al., 2018). The unwinding model of \\u03b3-secretase-APP interaction. This unwinding model of the substrate in \\u03b3-secretase-APP interaction suggests that targeting APP, especially the C-terminal of APPTM, could be a new strategy in selective amyloid reduction. A substrate-specific inhibitor is not expected to affect the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage of other physiological substrates, the assembly of the \\u03b3-secretase complex, or any presenilin function (Saura et al., 2004; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2012; Barthet et al., 2013), thereby sparing the side effects associated with broad-spectrum \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors. A novel compound C1 was found to interact with the C-terminal juxtamembrane lysines of APP and inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase production of A\\u03b2 both in vitro and in cell (Zhao et al., 2020). This study provides the first in vitro evidence that targeting the C-terminal juxtamembrane lysines is sufficient for reducing\",\n",

Importantly, these compounds do not accelerate the production of the potentially toxic product BACE1-C-terminal fragment (C99) (Toyn et al., 2016). In all species, research suggests that \\u03b3-secretase modulator treatment decrease A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 levels while increasing A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b237 by a corresponding amount. Therefore, the mechanism of action of \\u03b3-secretase modulators may translate well across species, validating its therapeutic strategy for utility in AD (Toyn et al., 2016). Other translational research across species has shown increased levels of plasma interleukin-10 following A\\u03b2 immunotherapy in Tg2576 mice (Town et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2007). Thereby, translation of inflammatory mechanisms and their peripheral markers may benefit from investigation of changes in microglial markers. However, when interpreting and comparing immune markers from mice caution is warranted, as recent evidence suggests that these markers do not translate well to human inflammatory diseases (Seok et al., 2013). Moreover, increased levels of isoprostanes have been shown in Tg2576 mice prior to plaque formation (Pratico et al., 2001), suggesting isoprostane levels may be useful as a predictive biomarker. Neurofilament light in bodily fluid constitutes a biomarker of neurodegeneration reflecting its translational value in system models and in clinical settings (Bacioglu et al., 2016). The earliest (current) detectable A\\u03b2 deposition in humans is the formation of diffuse plaques, whereas in the brain of Tg2576 mice diffuse plaques are not observed until 12 months of age, which is 4 months after biochemically detectable alterations of A\\u03b2 (Kawarabayashi et al., 2001). The most common observation in AD patients is minor amounts of A\\u03b240 deposited in the brain, whereas in 33% of patients great amounts of this A\\u03b2 variant are detected. Intriguingly, this latter group of patients also display substantial amyloid angiopathy (amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain) (Gravina et al., 1995). Similarly, the Tg2576 mouse model displays marked angiopathy and the deposition of a large amount of A\\u03b240 (Gravina et al., 1995). Generally CSF A\\u03b240 levels are much higher in patients compared to mice, while brain concentrations are similar (Karelina et al., 2017). In terms of plasma concentrations of A\\u03b240, this is highly similar between patients and mice, and therefore the greater A\\u03b240 concentrations observed in human CSF may likely reflect a higher brain production of the peptide (Karelina et al., 2017). In terms of the similarity between system models and patients, and specifically transgenic mice and human patients, mice and humans share virtually the same set of genes. Almost every gene found in mice or humans has been observed in a closely related form in the other. To look directly at differences along the AD disease cascade, we compare pathological events between the 3xTg AD mouse model and sporadic AD patients (Figure 4). The 3xTg AD mouse model develops amyloid and tau pathology, including amyloid plaques and NFTs (Oddo et al., 2003).

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

Because CSF A\\u03b242 levels are lower in patients with AD because of A\\u03b242 aggregation and precipitation in the brain [36], we measured A\\u03b242 levels in the same 3 cohort samples (Supplementary Table\\u00a02). Because cohort 3 samples were examined twice using different procedures, results are shown as cohort 3a and cohort 3b, respectively, in Supplementary Table\\u00a02. CSF A\\u03b242 levels were significantly lower in patients with AD and MCI than those in controls, in all three cohorts. CSF levels of total tau in cohort 1 and cohort 3a were significantly higher in patients with AD than those in controls. Likewise, tau levels tended to be elevated in patients with MCI. Levels of ptau were also higher in patients with AD and/or MCI than those in controls in cohort 2 and cohort 3b. Taken together, the p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels were largely lower in patients with AD than those in age-matched control subjects, there were also significantly lower A\\u03b242 levels and higher tau and ptau levels in CSF, which are characteristic features of AD subjects. To examine whether the change of p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels in the CSF of patients with AD is due to the alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity, we quantified the p3-Alc\\u03b2 levels of subjects who carry PSEN1 gene mutations (Fig.\\u00a04C). Given the limited amounts and numbers of samples, we only examined p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels. p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels in the CSF of PSEN1 gene mutation carriers (n\\u00a0=\\u00a09) (H163R, S169L, Q222H, M233T, S290C) were compared with p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels in the CSF of noncarrier subjects from the same families (n\\u00a0=\\u00a016), as well as subjects who carry APP gene mutations (n\\u00a0=\\u00a07) (E963Q and V717L) (Fig.\\u00a04C). Although it is difficult to compare these in same age subjects, and A\\u03b2 levels were not measured, the CSF from PSEN1 gene mutation carriers showed significantly reduced p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels compared with the CSF from the noncarrier subjects. A summary of study subject information is shown (Supplementary Table\\u00a03). Interestingly, seven of nine carrier subjects remained in a nondemented state (CDR 0), suggesting that the decrease in the CSF p3-Alc\\u03b237 level begins at a prodromal stage before MCI. The results suggest that alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity by disease-causative mutations of the PSEN1 gene also induce further the reduction in p3-Alc\\u03b237 levels in the CSF of individuals in\\u00a0vivo along with the decrease of Alc\\u03b2 expression. The decrease in p3-Alc\\u03b2 in the CSF of aged subjects may be due to a reduction of Alc\\u03b2 protein expression in the brain (Figs. 2 and 3). However, the alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity is also suggested to decrease p3-Alc\\u03b237 (Fig.\\u00a04C).

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

Recent studies support the notion that accumulation of the A\\u03b2 peptide arises from an imbalance in the production and clearance of A\\u03b2 and that the ability to clear A\\u03b2 diminishes with age (Wildsmith et al., 2013). An attractive early biomarker for AD is CSF A\\u03b242, given that both CSF t-tau and p-tau changes occur at a later time point in the disease process closer to clinically detectable dementia (Buchhave et al., 2012). Furthermore, measurement of the CSF A\\u03b242:A\\u03b240 ratio is superior to A\\u03b242 alone when distinguishing between MCI patients who progress and those that do not progress to AD dementia (Hansson et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2019). When comparing A\\u03b2 fluid biomarkers and imaging biomarkers, studies have shown that CSF A\\u03b242 can detect amyloid pathology earlier than amyloid PET imaging (Figure 3; Palmqvist et al., 2016). There appears to be a lack of consensus regarding CSF A\\u03b2 concentrations in AD patients. For instance, researchers have found that CSF A\\u03b242 concentrations increase (Nakamura et al., 1994; Bouwman et al., 2007), decrease (Kanai et al., 1998; Tapiola et al., 2000; Wahlund and Blennow, 2003; Mollenhauer et al., 2005; de Leon et al., 2006; Beckett et al., 2010), or experience no significant change (Andreasen et al., 1998, 1999a; Hoglund et al., 2005; Andersson et al., 2008; Brys et al., 2009; Stomrud et al., 2010) during the disease. The prevailing explanation for a reduced amount of A\\u03b2 in later stages of AD is that as the pathology progresses, more A\\u03b2, especially A\\u03b242, aggregates into plaques in the brain, which effectively means that less A\\u03b2 can diffuse from the brain to the CSF. Another explanation may be that A\\u03b2 first accumulates intracellularly, and neurodegeneration releases A\\u03b2 in the extracellular compartment, increasing CSF A\\u03b2 levels, and subsequently accumulates onto neuronal surfaces and in synapses as it clears away from the CSF. As neurodegeneration occurs, less A\\u03b2 is produced and therefore smaller amounts will accumulate in the CSF and subsequently in the brain, where A\\u03b2 will reach plateau levels. Alternatively, reduced CSF A\\u03b242 might follow neuronal dysfunction, which results in decreased metabolism of APP and A\\u03b2. It is important to note that this is unlikely in transgenic mice, as A\\u03b242 levels in the CSF decline, while its levels in the brain keep rising. Also, when above a certain level, parts of CSF A\\u03b242 may aggregate into a large assembly that antibodies of currently used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits cannot capture (Pitschke et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2004). These seemingly disparate findings regarding CSF A\\u03b2 concentrations may therefore reflect different timepoints of the disease progression. With regard to studies using A\\u03b2 as a fluid biomarker for AD, studies have shown that concentrations of CSF A\\u03b242 increased between 5 and 7 months of age, but not between 8 and 13 months of age in an APP/PS1 mouse model (Liu et al., 2004). This was despite a rapid increase in brain levels of A\\u03b242 (Liu et al.,\",\n",

Panelists agreed on the clinical workspace of the workflow (specialist outpatient service), the stage of application (prodromal and mild dementia), and the patient age window (biomarker use strongly encouraged below 70 years and of limited usefulness over age 85). The workflow is patient-centered and features three levels of assessment (W): W1 defines eleven clinical profiles based on integrated results of neuropsychology, MRI atrophy patterns, and blood tests; W2 describes the first-line biomarkers according to W1 versus clinical suspicion; and W3 suggests the second-line biomarkers when the results of first-line biomarkers are inconsistent with the diagnostic hypothesis, uninformative or inconclusive. More specifically, CSF biomarkers are first-line in the suspect of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) and when inconsistent neuropsychological and MRI findings hinder a clear diagnostic hypothesis; dopamine SPECT/PET for those leading to suspect Lewy body spectrum. FDG-PET is first-line for the clinical profiles leading to suspect frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor tauopathies and is followed by CSF biomarkers in the case of atypical metabolic patterns, when an underlying AD etiology is conceivable. None of these biomarkers is indicated when clinical profiles suggest vascular cognitive impairment or other neurological disorders. Conclusions: The workflow will promote consistency in diagnosing neurocognitive disorders across countries and rational use of resources. The initiative has some limitations, mainly linked to the Delphi procedure (e.g., kick-off questions were driven by the moderators, answers are driven by the Delphi panel composition, a subtle phrasing of the questions may drive answers, and 70% threshold for convergence is conventional). However, the diagnostic workflow will be able to help clinicians achieve an early and sustainable etiological diagnosis and enable the use of disease-modifying drugs as soon as they become available.

Background: Detecting amyloid pathologies has become increasingly important for selecting patients for clinical trials and diagnosing Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) in clinical practice. Although amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid concentration of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b240 reflect the presence of amyloid pathologies, these methods are expensive and/or invasive. To overcome these limitations, studies have focused on the use of blood-based biomarkers.

      "RESULT OF PUBMED API:\n",
      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are critical in the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This highlights the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to reduce the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents an opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43, in particular, is linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), which underscores the need for effective GSEC modulation (Hata et al., 2019; Jing et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For instance, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly in light of the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by studies showing that GSEC inhibition can lead to altered Aβ peptide profiles without exacerbating the production of toxic fragments like C99 (Lauritzen et al., 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio is indicative of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition. Neurofilament light protein is also emerging as a biomarker of neurodegeneration, reflecting its translational value in both animal models and clinical settings (Bacioglu et al., 2016). These biomarkers can guide clinical decision-making and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, including neuroimaging techniques (such as PET scans detecting amyloid deposition) and CSF analysis for Aβ peptides, have significant clinical relevance. They assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and facilitate the identification of patients who may benefit from GSEC-targeted therapies. The use of these biomarkers in clinical trials can also help stratify patients based on their likelihood of response to GSEC modulators, thereby optimizing trial outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches in AD treatment. The correlation between CSF Aβ levels and brain deposition further emphasizes the role of these biomarkers in understanding GSEC activity and its implications for AD (Tao-Ran et al., 2022). \n",

      "- **CSF Aβ42 levels:** Reduced levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could indicate effective inhibition of gamma secretase.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers for AD, such as CSF Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau levels, as well as amyloid PET imaging, are clinically relevant for diagnosing AD and assessing disease progression. These biomarkers can also be utilized to monitor the therapeutic effects of gamma secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, providing valuable information on their efficacy and mechanism of action.\n",

      "####################draft 0: The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is a continuous process that describes the movement of water within the Earth's atmosphere, land, and bodies of water. The cycle can be broken down into several key stages:\n",

      "1. **Evaporation**: The process begins when the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. This heat causes the water to evaporate, turning it into water vapor that rises into the atmosphere. Plants also contribute to this process through transpiration, where water is absorbed by roots and released as vapor from leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Condensation**: As water vapor rises, it cools and condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds. This process occurs when the air temperature drops and the water vapor reaches its dew point, leading to the formation of clouds in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Precipitation**: Eventually, the water droplets in clouds combine to form larger droplets. When they become heavy enough, they fall back to the Earth's surface as precipitation in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail, depending on the temperature conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Collection**: The precipitation collects in bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and oceans. Some of it also infiltrates the ground, replenishing groundwater supplies. This collected water will eventually return to the atmosphere through evaporation, continuing the cycle.\n",
