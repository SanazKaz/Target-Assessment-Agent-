    "### Develop a scientific rationale for the following:\n",
    "                             \n",
    "    **Given target:** Gamma secretase\n",
    "    **Given disease:** Alzheimer's disease\n",
    "    **Given mode of action:** Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Context:\n",
    "Aβ is a family of secreted peptides generated from the sequential cleavages of the type 1 membrane protein APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and gamma-secretase (GSEC), respectively. \n",
    "BACE cleaves APP in the luminal domain, releasing the N-terminal soluble APPβ domain and leaving the C-terminal fragment, APP-CTF, which remains in the membrane. \n",
    "Subsequently, the APP-CTF is recruited to GSEC, a complex comprising four subunits, including PS, which harbors the active site. GSEC first cuts APP-CTF at the epsilon-cleavage site located close to the inner leaflet of the membrane. \n",
    "This cleavage event produces either Aβ48 or Aβ49 and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The membrane-retained Aβ48 or Aβ49 is then further processed by GSEC in a continuous cascade of proteolytical events at every third of fourth amino acid, where the N-terminal product of each reaction becomes the substrate for the next GSEC cleavage event.\n",
    "Accordingly, GSEC processes APP-CTF along two main product lines, Aβ49 → 46 → 43 → 40 → 37… and Aβ48 → 45 → 42 → 38…, respectively. During this processing cascade, Aβ43 and shorter Aβ peptides stochastically escape further processing by GSEC and are released into the extracellular space. \n",
    "As a result, Aβ peptides varying from 30 to 43 amino acids in length are secreted into the extracellular space. Among all secreted Aβ, Aβ40 is the most abundant in human CSF, followed by Aβ38, Aβ42, and Aβ37. In cognitively normal individuals, Aβ42 and Aβ43 represent a smaller portion of the total secreted Aβ.\n",
    "These longer forms of Aβ seed the formation of Aβ-amyloid aggregates, a key step in the formation of amyloid plaques (Veugelen et al., 2016), as illustrated in Figure 1. Aβ42, which is produced in higher amounts than Aβ43, is the most abundant Aβ in amyloid plaques (Welander et al., 2009).\n",

As a superior alternative to gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), they maintain partial NOTCH signaling to reduce adverse effects. The selective inhibitor MRK-560 effectively decreases mutant NOTCH1 processing in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with minimal side effects. The overarching role of NOTCH signaling in multiple diseases, including immune responses and cancers, emphasizes its significance in drug discovery and development of biomarkers for various pathological conditions.\\n\\n8\": {\n",

A phase III clinical trial for nirogacestat has already been registered, although the trial has yet to begin (NCT03785964). In addition to cancer, because NOTCH plays a critical role in the differentiation of Th cells, GSIs have also been studied in allergic diseases such as asthma572. NOTCH signaling regulates Th1 and Th2 responses in allergic pulmonary inflammation, indicating its promising targetability in immune disease. \\u03b3-Secretase modulators (GSMs) were originally studied in AD573. As a superior option to GSIs, GSMs aim to modify the catalytic activity of \\u03b3-secretase rather than to nonselectively inhibit it, enabling partial NOTCH signaling function to be maintained and thus theoretically ameliorating adverse events574. The selective inhibitor MRK-560 targeting PSEN1, an important catalytic subclass of \\u03b3-secretase complexes, has been proven to effectively decrease mutant NOTCH1 processing and cause cell cycle arrest in T-ALL without associated gut toxicity575. GSMs are only applied in AD as drugs that are designed to modulate amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptide generation without impacting the function of NOTCH576,577. Given the severe adverse events of inhibiting the overall NOTCH pathway, antibodies targeting different receptors and ligands have been explored to achieve precise targeting of NOTCH signaling578,579. There are five ligands and four receptors in the NOTCH signaling pathway21. Although the roles of each component are not completely clear, functions related to specific diseases have been confirmed, making them potential targets41. As reported previously, the upregulated expression of JAG1 enhances proliferation and angiogenesis in various malignant tumors, including adrenocortical carcinoma580, breast cancer379, and prostate cancer581. These pathological mechanisms make JAG1 a promising target, and monoclonal antibodies against JAG1 have been studied in breast cancer582, ovarian cancer396, and other malignant tumors582. 15D11, one of the most promising fully human monoclonal antibodies against JAG1, has been studied at the preclinical stage; 15D11 increases chemotherapy sensitivity, reduces neoplastic growth in bone metastases, and, most importantly, causes minor adverse effects583. DLL3 is an inhibitory ligand of NOTCH signaling that is highly upregulated and aberrantly expressed on the cell surface of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and other high-grade neuroendocrine tumors as a key driving gene55,584,585. DLL3-directed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) induce durable and safe responses in SCLC and large-cell neuroendocrine cancer (LCNEC) PDX tumor models427. Positive results inspired further clinical trials. In 2017, Charles M Rudin et al. first reported their encouraging results of rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T); 11 of 60 assessable patients with SCLC or LCNEC had confirmed objective responses, and the objective response rate (ORR) was relatively higher in patients with high DLL3 expression. Although 38% of 74 patients suffered severe drug-related AEs, the AEs could be controlled579. Unfortunately, further phase II and III studies failed to achieve their efficacy end points. Relapsed/refractory SCLC patients receiving Rova-T after at least two lines of therapy achieved a median overall survival\",\n",

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with GPR3 KO mice also decreased A\\u03b2 production, and GPR3 was expressed in the brains of SAD patients92.

Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) was also reported to regulate the assembly of \\u03b3-secretase complexes and contribute to A\\u03b2 pathogenesis208. SERP1 interacts with the Aph-1a/Nct subcomplex of \\u03b3-secretase and increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 generation but reduces Notch processing208.

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211. Hur et al.158 showed that IFITM3 binds to PS1-NTF in active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production (A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242) (Fig. 6).

While the FDA approved aducanumab, the first A\\u03b2-targeted therapy, multiple safe and effective treatments will be needed to target the complex pathologies of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that is critical for the generation of A\\u03b2 peptides. Activity and specificity of \\u03b3-secretase are regulated by both obligatory subunits and modulatory proteins. Due to its complex structure and function and early clinical failures with pan inhibitors, \\u03b3-secretase has been a challenging drug target for AD. \\u03b3-secretase modulators, however, have dramatically shifted the approach to targeting \\u03b3-secretase. Here we review \\u03b3-secretase and small molecule modulators, from the initial characterization of a subset of NSAIDs to the most recent clinical candidates. We also discuss the chemical biology of \\u03b3-secretase, in which small molecule probes enabled structural and functional insights into \\u03b3-secretase before the emergence of high-resolution structural studies. Finally, we discuss the recent crystal structures of \\u03b3-secretase, which have provided valuable perspectives on substrate recognition and molecular mechanisms of small molecules. We conclude that modulation of \\u03b3-secretase will be part of a new wave of AD therapeutics.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia affecting more than 6 million Americans. In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4]. While the underlying disease mechanisms are complex and still being elucidated, multiple lines of evidence support the \\u201camyloid hypothesis,\\u201d which posits that the accumulation of A\\u03b2 peptides initiates a chain of pathological events, including formation of neurofibrillary tangles and inflammatory responses, leading to widespread neurodegeneration and ultimately AD [5, 6].

On the other hand, a co-immunoprecipitation study against \\u03b3-secretase complex components pulled down both active and inactive \\u03b3-secretase complexes. In animal studies, GSIs successfully reduced A\\u03b2 production. DAPT decreased A\\u03b2 levels in the plasma, CSF, or brain of AD transgenic mice117,120. Chronic treatment with LY-411,575 in AD transgenic mice reduced A\\u03b2 but also inhibited Notch signaling, leading to side effects121. Semagacestat (LY-450,139) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163) in Tg2576 mice reduced A\\u03b2 production while increasing APP-CTF122. However, those GSIs impaired normal cognition in wild-type mice122. Begacestat (GSI-953) reduced A\\u03b2 levels in Tg2576 mice123. In clinical trials, GSIs such as semagacestat (LY-450,139, Eli Lilly) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163, Bristol-Myers Squibb) reduced A\\u03b2 production in AD patients124,125. However, the multitude of \\u03b3-secretase substrates has made the development of clinically useful inhibitors difficult. Due to the decreased Notch signaling and the accumulation of APP-CTFs122, side effects such as the risk of skin cancer and infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and worsening cognition led to the pause of clinical trials5,124,125. Therefore, these GSIs are nonselective and inhibit both APP and Notch121,124,126. Avagacestat was reported as a \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI and was shown to have a higher selectivity for APP over Notch cleavage127. However, avagacestat was suggested to be nonselective later based on poor Notch-sparing activity122,128 and its binding site as PS1-NTF128. Another \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI, begacestat (GSI-953, Wyeth/Pfizer), was also discontinued in phase I clinical trial, and the reasons are unclear129. Another concern regarding GSI treatment is the A\\u03b2 rebound effect. GSIs at lower doses increased A\\u03b2 levels, and discontinuation of GSI treatment was observed with a rebound of A\\u03b2 levels130,131. These GSIs target PS1-NTF128. GSIs have been repurposed in the cancer field for Notch signaling inhibition and are currently in clinical trials. Instead of inhibiting the whole \\u03b3-secretase activity, modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity by \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) has been tested. GSMs are more attractive disease-modifying agents than GSIs because GSMs (1) inhibit selectively aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 production, (2) increase shorter A\\u03b237 or A\\u03b238 species, (3) do not affect the total A\\u03b2 production and the accumulation of APP-CTF, and (4) spare Notch processing132.

This A\\u03b2 modulation was not due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity, the pharmacological target of NSAIDs133.

After cleavage by furin-like protease in the Golgi and ADAM metalloproteases at S1 and S2 respectively, Notch is cleaved by \\u03b3-secretase at S3 (analogous to the \\u03b5-cleavage site of APP) to release the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor to activate target genes [44]. \\u03b3-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) failed in clinical trials due to nonselective inhibition of substrates. Semagacestat and Avagacestat are among the most widely known cases (Fig.\\u00a03). Semagacestat (LY-450,139) terminated in phase III due to increased risk for skin cancer, associated with inhibition of Notch1 signaling, and cognitive worsening [45\\u201348]. In dosing and kinetic studies, the high concentration of Semagacestat given during the once a day regimen likely resulted in \\u201cbursts\\u201d of full inactivation which lead to inhibition of Notch and other substrates [49].Fig. 3Structures of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in AD clinical trials Structures of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in AD clinical trials Avagacestat (BMS-708,163) was referred to as \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d inhibitor. However, it was terminated in phase II due to increased risk for skin cancer and gastrointestinal distress [50, 51]. Mechanistically, the specificity of Avagacestat for APP and Notch has been questioned [52, 53]. While GSIs did not succeed in AD clinical trials, due to their inhibition of Notch signaling several GSIs have been pursued in clinical trials for various cancers [54\\u201356]. Their applications as chemical probes have also been valuable for advancing our understanding of the structure and regulation of \\u03b3-secretase [57]. Recently, an imaging probe based on semagacestat demonstrated high specificity and increased uptake in tumor mouse models, suggesting that such tracers could be used to monitor \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and target engagement in clinical responses [58]. The shifting approach from global inhibition t subtle modulation of \\u03b3-secretase has resulted in the development of \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs). Weggen et al. first characterized a subset of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and sulindac sulfide, which selectively reduce levels of the pathogenic A\\u03b242 in favor of the shorter and less pathogenic A\\u03b238 without inhibition of Notch (Fig.\\u00a04) [59]. These effects were separate from their inhibitory effects of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and so were considered the first generation GSMs. However, these NSAIDs displayed weak in vitro potency and poor brain penetration and entered clinical trials with limited success [60]. Tarenflurbil (R-flurbiprofen), with A\\u03b242 IC50\\u2009~\\u2009200\\u2013300\\u00a0\\u03bcM, slowed cognitive decline in patients with mild AD in phase II, but did not achieve clinical outcome in phase III [61].Fig. 4Structures of representative first generation \\u03b3-secretase modulators Structures of representative first generation \\u03b3-secretase modulators Second generation GSMs were developed to improve upon these parameters.

While these structural studies will need to be supported by experimental data, they can be applied towards rational design of the next generation GSIs and GSMs for AD therapeutics. While targeting \\u03b3-secretase has proven challenging, it should not diminish its potential as a crucial target for AD pathogenesis. The serious toxicities that halted clinical studies of GSIs demonstrated there were many knowledge gaps about \\u03b3-secretase biology and underestimation of its nuanced proteolysis before the compounds were evaluated in humans [49]. GSMs aim to stimulate \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s carboxypeptidase-like trimming of A\\u03b2 peptides to their shorter, less pathogenic forms. Over the past two decades, industry and academic groups have optimized the potency and CNS penetration of GSMs, several of which have started clinical trials. The success of small molecule GSMs, as with other A\\u03b2-targeted therapies, also depend on being administered in the early stages of AD pathology well before clinical manifestations. Amyloid-based biomarkers and diagnostics will be vital to identifying and monitoring trial subjects. The development of the first GSM-based radiotracer suggests that that \\u03b3-secretase expression could be monitored in AD patients. In the past several years, detailed structures of \\u03b3-secretase have emerged. These structures have already been used in computational docking studies for GSMs [91]. Modeling GSMs with varying chemotypes could be insightful for comparing their mechanisms of recognizing and altering substrate and enzyme transmembrane domains.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) or ADAM17 (also called tumor necrosis factor-alpha convertase, TACE) can be exploited to prevent S2 cleavage and NOTCH signaling transmission, as they are key enzymes of S2 cleavage62,541\\u2013543. Similar to SERCA inhibitors, ADAM inhibitors target the entire NOTCH pathway. Small molecule drugs targeting ADAMs have been studied in non-small-cell lung cancer544, hepatocellular carcinoma545, renal carcinoma546, breast cancer547, and systemic sclerosis548. Some of these inhibitors have shown anti-NOTCH activities in vitro and in animal experiments, yet no clinical trial has been initiated. The canonical signal transmission of NOTCH signaling from outisde the cell to inside the cell relies heavily on S3 cleavage mediated by the \\u03b3-secretase complex549,550, suggesting that it is promising to modulate the function of \\u03b3-secretase for treatment. \\u03b3-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were first tested as a treatment for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) in clinical trials because \\u03b3-secretase contributes to catalyzing the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptide. Unfortunately, the study was terminated shortly after it began because of serious NOTCH-associated adverse events such as gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and nonmelanoma skin cancers551. Since then, researchers have attempted to treat cancer with GSIs to disrupt NOTCH signaling. In preclinical studies, GSIs are widely studied as a treatment for cancer, showing antitumor activity in diverse tumor types, such as breast cancer552,553, hepatocellular carcinoma554,555, non-small-cell lung cancer556, colorectal cancer557, prostate cancer558, and gliomas559. Cancer patients were first documented to receive GSI treatment in 2006, with one of six patients with T-ALL or acute myeloid leukemia receiving MK-0752 in a phase I clinical trial; the trial showed a promising 45% reduction in mediastinal mass after 28 days, although the treatment was paused because of severe diarrhea (NCT00100152). Other drugs, including PF-03084014560, RO4929097561,562, BMS-986115563, LY900009564, LY3039478565, and MK-0752566,567, have emerged in phase I trials, all of which have shown antitumor efficacy. However, most have presented dose-limiting toxicities. To date, only RO4929097 and PF-03084014 have entered phase II trials. Unfortunately, although the adverse events (AEs) were well tolerated, only 1 patient among 32 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with RO4929097 achieved a partial response568. Similar outcomes occurred in platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer, with no objective response among valid participants569,570; thus, few agents have entered phase III/IV clinical trials. PF-03084014, also called nirogacestat, achieved more promising outcomes in patients with desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) than RO4929097, as 29% of the 15 patients experienced a confirmed partial response that was maintained for more than 2 years571.

      "        \"original_text\": \"-secretase inhibitor The NOTCH signaling pathway has certain characteristics. Classical signaling pathways, mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)39 and enzyme-linked receptors40, have multiple intermediates between the membranous receptors and nuclear effectors. However, the canonical NOTCH signaling pathway has no intermediate, with receptors directly translocated into the nucleus after three cleavages21,41,42 (Fig. 2). In addition, S2 cleavage of NOTCH receptors is triggered by interactions with ligands expressed on adjacent cells, indicating a rather narrow range of NOTCH signaling. NOTCH signaling is involved in multiple aspects of metazoans\\u2019 life42, including cell fate decisions, embryo and tissue development, tissue functions and repair, as well as noncancerous and cancerous diseases. Thus, understanding of the architecture of the NOTCH signaling pathway is necessary.Fig. 2Overview of the NOTCH signaling pathway and therapeutic targets. In signal-receiving cells, NOTCH receptors are first generated in the ER and then trafficked to the Golgi apparatus. During trafficking, NOTCH receptors are glycosylated at the EGF-like repeat domain (red curves). Then, in the Golgi apparatus, NOTCH receptors are cleaved into heterodimers (S1 cleavage) and transported to the cell membrane. With the help of ubiquitin ligases, some of the NOTCH receptors on the cell membrane are endocytosed into endosomes. Endosomes contain an acidic environment with ADAMs and \\u03b3-secretase. The NOTCH receptors in endosomes can be recycled to the cell membrane, cleaved into NICD, or transported into lysosomes for degradation. In signal-sending cells, NOTCH ligands are distributed on the cell membrane and can bind to NOTCH receptors on signal-receiving cells. However, the ligands are inactive before ubiquitylation by Neur or Mib. After ubiquitylation, ligands can be endocytosed, thus producing a pulling force for the binding receptors. Without the pulling force, the S2 site (red marks) of NOTCH receptors is hidden by the NRR domain, and thus, the NOTCH receptors are resistant to cleavage by ADAMs. With the pulling force, the NRR domain is extended, therefore exposing the S2 site for cleavage. ADAMs and the pulling force are both necessary for S2 cleavage. After S2 cleavage, the remaining part of the NOTCH receptor is called NEXT. NEXT can be further cleaved on the cell membrane by \\u03b3-secretase or endocytosed into endosomes. In the former mode, NICD is released on the cell membrane. In the latter mode, NEXT can be cleaved into NICD or transported into lysosomes for degradation. In total, there are three approaches to generate NICD, classified as ligand-independent activation, ligand-dependent endocytosis-independent activation, and ligand-dependent endocytic activation. NICD can be translocated into the nucleus or remain in the cytoplasm to crosstalk with other signaling pathways, such as NF\\u03baB, mTORC2, AKT, and Wnt. The classical model proposes that, in the absence of NICD, CSL binds with corepressors to inhibit the transcription of target genes. Once NICD enters the nucleus, it can bind with CSL and recruit MAMLs, releasing corepressors, recruiting coactivators, and thus promoting the transcription of NOTCH target genes. There are two\",\n",

However, it has been debated whether it is due to a gain or loss of PS function that results in an increased A\\u03b242/40 ratio113. An A\\u03b242/40 ratio increase could be due to increased A\\u03b242 production, decreased A\\u03b240 production, or a combination of both111. Analysis of the formation of substrate CTFs, ICDs, and A\\u03b2 species as the effect of FAD mutations of PSEN1 or PSEN2 on the cleavage of various \\u03b3-secretase substrates, such as APP, Notch, syndecan-3, N-cadherin, and \\u03b21-integrin, showed that different mutations had a varying effect on substrate processing, indicating \\u201cvariable\\u201d or \\u201cpartial\\u201d loss of PS protein function, and PS2 was less efficient than PS1111. Reconstitution of the PS protein from 138 PS1 FAD mutations with Aph-1aL containing \\u03b3-secretase mostly decreased the production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, increased the A\\u03b242/40 ratio, and suggested the loss of PS1 function114. However, these 138 PS1 FAD mutations also showed that different mutations displayed variations in A\\u03b242 or A\\u03b240 production (increase or decrease)114. In addition, further studies addressing the effect of PS FAD mutations on the structure of \\u03b3-secretase and how those conformational changes could affect the cleavage of different substrates by \\u03b3-secretase remain to be investigated. For instance, E280 in PS1 forms hydrogen bonds with Y159 and Y154102. PS1 E280A (the Columbian mutation) disrupts hydrogen bonds and causes a local conformational change102. Over the years, small molecule inhibitors and modulators targeting \\u03b3-secretase have been developed as potential disease-modifying agents in AD. The main goal is to target \\u03b3-secretase and reduce toxic A\\u03b242 species while sparing other substrate cleavage processing by \\u03b3-secretase. GSIs bind to the active site of PS and inhibit \\u03b3-secretase cleavage, thereby reducing total A\\u03b2 production.

      "The hypothesis is that targeting gamma secretase (GSEC) can modulate the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, thereby reducing the formation of amyloid plaques, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By selectively inhibiting GSEC activity, it may be possible to shift the balance of Aβ production towards the generation of shorter, less aggregation-prone forms of Aβ, such as Aβ40, while minimizing the production of neurotoxic Aβ42. This approach could potentially slow or halt the progression of AD by addressing one of its underlying pathological mechanisms.\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options that primarily address symptoms rather than the underlying pathology. Current therapies do not significantly alter the course of the disease, and there remains a pressing need for disease-modifying treatments that can effectively target the production of Aβ peptides and their aggregation into plaques. Given the central role of GSEC in the generation of Aβ peptides, targeting this enzyme presents a novel therapeutic strategy to meet this unmet medical need.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Targeting GSEC could be suitable for combination therapy with other modalities that address different aspects of AD pathology. For instance, combining GSEC inhibitors with agents that enhance neuroprotection, improve synaptic function, or modulate tau pathology may provide a more comprehensive approach to treatment. Such combination strategies could potentially enhance therapeutic efficacy by simultaneously addressing multiple pathways involved in AD progression, thereby improving patient outcomes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Potential predictive biomarkers for GSEC-targeted therapies include the levels of different Aβ species in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. Specifically, the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 could serve as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of GSEC inhibition, as a decrease in Aβ42 levels relative to Aβ40 would indicate a successful modulation of the cleavage process. Additionally, monitoring changes in the APP intracellular domain (AICD) could provide insights into GSEC activity and its impact on cellular signaling pathways relevant to AD.\n",

      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers such as CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, and tau levels have been shown to correlate with disease progression and cognitive decline in AD patients. The clinical relevance of these biomarkers lies in their ability to facilitate early diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and evaluate the response to therapeutic interventions. For GSEC-targeted therapies, these biomarkers could be instrumental in stratifying patients based on their baseline Aβ profiles and predicting treatment responses, thereby enhancing the precision of clinical trials and therapeutic applications.########################################\n",

Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45).

Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible.

Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4.

This inhibition could explain the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein carboxy-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) in familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (FAD) brains despite unchanged overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels in post-mortem samples. Increased endolysosomal A\\u03b242 appears to initiate a feedback mechanism that impairs \\u03b3-secretase signaling, suggesting a role in neurotoxicity and AD pathogenesis. The data propose that elevated A\\u03b242 levels correlate with neurodegeneration processes involving \\u03b3-secretase. \\n\\n8\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

The imbalance in A\\u03b2 production and clearance can lead to plaque formation and subsequent neurodegeneration. While \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have been investigated, they often lead to undesirable side effects due to the disruption of Notch signaling, necessitating the development of \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that specifically target A\\u03b2 metabolism without impairing other functions.\\n\\nScore: 9\": {\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7. Both A\\u03b2 oligomers and plaques damage neurons by astrocytic activation, oxidative\",\n",

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with GPR3 KO mice also decreased A\\u03b2 production, and GPR3 was expressed in the brains of SAD patients92.

Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) was also reported to regulate the assembly of \\u03b3-secretase complexes and contribute to A\\u03b2 pathogenesis208. SERP1 interacts with the Aph-1a/Nct subcomplex of \\u03b3-secretase and increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 generation but reduces Notch processing208.

Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211. Hur et al.158 showed that IFITM3 binds to PS1-NTF in active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production (A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242) (Fig. 6).

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238. We note that \\u03b3-secretase processes A\\u03b243 into A\\u03b240 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5\\u20131 \\u03bcM) (30). Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u03bcM A\\u03b242, for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to the feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Hur, 2022).\n",

      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

Notably, p-tau/A\\u03b242 (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 100%) was a good discriminator of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other dementia syndromes [36] (Table 1). Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141]. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein is involved with the transportation of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated as a biomarker of brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [142].

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238. We note that \\u03b3-secretase processes A\\u03b243 into A\\u03b240 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5\\u20131 \\u03bcM) (30). Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u03bcM A\\u03b242, for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to the feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and total tau levels in CSF, have been widely studied and are clinically relevant in diagnosing AD. Elevated Aβ42 levels in the presence of decreased Aβ40 are indicative of amyloid plaque formation, while increased tau levels correlate with neurodegeneration. These biomarkers can aid in identifying individuals at risk for AD and in stratifying patients for clinical trials targeting γ-secretase and Aβ metabolism (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024). By integrating biomarker data with clinical assessments, researchers can better understand the relationship between γ-secretase activity, Aβ metabolism, and disease progression in AD.\n",

Publications that were not in English were excluded due to the challenges of evaluating the contents as accessible open resources. The most relevant or primary studies were included in this analysis, and replicated contents were omitted along with studies with a small sample size (Figure 1). Studies with important findings of key CSF biomarkers are included in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Of note, key findings of meta-analysis articles are given in Table 1. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

This results in synaptic loss, neuronal loss (notably, the temporoparietal association cortices and medial temporal lobe structures), memory impairment, and enhanced cognitive dysfunction due to progressive neuronal degeneration [17,18]. There are two types of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, classified according to pathological factors and the age of commencement. Early-onset or familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is multifactorial and has a sporadic occurrence. These patients usually present with other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 1and 2), obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome [2]. In the second type\\u2014late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease\\u2014there is an elevation of A\\u03b242 fragment levels, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and excitotoxicity. The pathological process of late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease involves mitochondrial damage of neurons, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the vascular endothelium [19]. Existing biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease include (1) A\\u03b242 (the 42 amino acid form of amyloid \\u03b2) in CSF and (2) total and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF [20]. The utilization of these biomarkers, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, contribute to the early detection of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, with higher diagnostic certainty [21]. The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) system, a biomarker-based biological classification, was published in 2018 by a work group commissioned by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association [22]. There is a reference to A (representing amyloid plaques) and T (tau neurofibrillary tangles); these biomarkers are precise neuropathological indicators of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The \\u03b2-amyloid biomarker is assessed by measuring CSF A\\u03b242 levels using immunoassays for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry or detection of amyloid PET [23]. Phosphorylated tau has been measured extensively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or detected on tau positron emission tomography (PET) [24]. N represents biomarkers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration, which are assessed by measuring total tau in CSF by ELISA or atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; the latter not regarded as disease-specific [25]. There are respective cut-off points for A, T, and N, which are classified as normal (\\u2212) or abnormal (+), with, subsequently, eight different AT(N) biomarker profiles [26]. Over the last two decades, there has been significant growth in the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.

Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141]. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein is involved with the transportation of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated as a biomarker of brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [142].

In 2017, the Geneva AD Biomarker Roadmap Initiative adapted a framework for the systematic validation of oncological biomarkers to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers\\u2014encompassing the 42 amino-acid isoform of amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242), phosphorylated-tau (P-tau), and Total-tau (T-tau)\\u2014with the aim to accelerate their development and clinical implementation. The aim of this work is to update the current validation status of CSF AD biomarkers based on the Biomarker Roadmap methodology. A panel of experts in AD biomarkers convened in November 2019 at a 2-day workshop in Geneva. The level of maturity (fully achieved, partly achieved, preliminary evidence, not achieved, unsuccessful) of CSF AD biomarkers was assessed based on the Biomarker Roadmap methodology before the meeting and presented and discussed during the workshop. By comparison to the previous 2017 Geneva Roadmap meeting, the primary advances in CSF AD biomarkers have been in the area of a unified protocol for CSF sampling, handling and storage, the introduction of certified reference methods and materials for A\\u03b242, and the introduction of fully automated assays. Additional advances have occurred in the form of defining thresholds for biomarker positivity and assessing the impact of covariates on their discriminatory ability. Though much has been achieved for phases one through three, much work remains in phases four (real world performance) and five (assessment of impact/cost). To a large degree, this will depend on the availability of disease-modifying treatments for AD, given these will make accurate and generally available diagnostic tools key to initiate therapy.

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

Over the last two decades, there has been significant growth in the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review presents current evidence from many clinical neurochemical studies, with findings that attest to the efficacy of existing core CSF biomarkers such as total tau, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242), which diagnose Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in the early and dementia stages of the disorder. The heterogeneity of the pathophysiology of the late-onset disease warrants the growth of the Alzheimer\\u2019s disease CSF biomarker toolbox; more biomarkers showing other aspects of the disease mechanism are needed. This review focuses on new biomarkers that track Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathology, such as those that assess neuronal injury (VILIP-1 and neurofilament light), neuroinflammation (sTREM2, YKL-40, osteopontin, GFAP, progranulin, and MCP-1), synaptic dysfunction (SNAP-25 and GAP-43), vascular dysregulation (hFABP), as well as CSF \\u03b1-synuclein levels and TDP-43 pathology. Some of these biomarkers are promising candidates as they are specific and predict future rates of cognitive decline. Findings from the combinations of subclasses of new Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarkers that improve their diagnostic efficacy in detecting associated pathological changes are also presented.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nDementia defines a collection of symptoms due to acquired loss of cognition in numerous domains in such a manner that affects memory, occupational function, and thinking ability.

A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [45]. As one of the biomarkers of neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, its levels in CSF are found to be decreased. Decreased concentrations of CSF A\\u03b242 to approximately 50% have been reported in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease compared to healthy controls [46]. In a meta-analysis that comprised 231 studies, including 13,018 controls and 15,699 patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, lower CSF A\\u03b242 concentrations discriminated between those with the disease and controls (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.55\\u20130.58, p < 0\\u00b70001) [27] (Table 1). Likewise, [47] conducted a cross-sectional retrospective evaluation of 17 meta-analyses studies, where there was a comparison of baseline CSF A\\u03b242 concentrations in controls and Alzheimer\\u2019s patients. They reported a reduction in 14 studies (2 studies were unclear) [48,49]. However, in one of the studies, there was an increase in A\\u03b242 concentrations in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in the early and mid-stages [50]. In terms of the clinical utility of CSF A\\u03b242, a mean specificity of 82% (95% CI:\\u200974\\u201388%) and sensitivity of 80% (95% CI:\\u200973\\u201385%) has been stated [51]. The biomarker CSF A\\u03b242, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, establishes acceptable biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. CSF A\\u03b242 is useful for differentiating between Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases [52,53]. In a prospective cohort study, including 65 patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, 26 patients with vascular dementia, and 50 controls, there were significant differences in A\\u03b242 between the two patient groups [53]. In another study, CSF A\\u03b242 had the potential to differentiate Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia from frontotemporal dementia (sensitivity 85%, specificity 77%) [54]. However, there are studies that have reported that A\\u03b242 was not able to discriminate between Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and vascular dementia as its levels were decreased in both disease states [55,56]. There is evidence that suggests that A\\u03b242 may be predictive of the procession of persons with normal cognition and those with mild cognitive impairment [28,57,58]. Buchhave et al. conducted a clinical study of 137 patients with mild cognitive impairment, followed-up for 4.1\\u201311.8 years. They found that that CSF A\\u03b242 precisely predicts the progression of the disease as its levels were significantly reduced at least 5\\u201310 years before conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [57]. Likewise, in the meta-analyses conducted by Diniz and colleagues, low levels of CSF A\\u03b242 were predictive of individuals with mild cognitive impairment who later develop Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [28] (Table 1).

The number of people living with AD is predicted to increase; however, there are no disease-modifying therapies currently available and none have been successful in late-stage clinical trials. Fluid biomarkers measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood hold promise for enabling more effective drug development and establishing a more personalized medicine approach for AD diagnosis and treatment. Biomarkers used in drug development programmes should be qualified for a specific context of use (COU). These COUs include, but are not limited to, subject/patient selection, assessment of disease state and/or prognosis, assessment of mechanism of action, dose optimization, drug response monitoring, efficacy maximization, and toxicity/adverse reactions identification and minimization. The core AD CSF biomarkers A\\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau are recognized by research guidelines for their diagnostic utility and are being considered for qualification for subject selection in clinical trials. However, there is a need to better understand their potential for other COUs, as well as identify additional fluid biomarkers reflecting other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Several novel fluid biomarkers have been proposed, but their role in AD pathology and their use as AD biomarkers have yet to be validated. In this review, we summarize some of the pathological mechanisms implicated in the sporadic AD and highlight the data for several established and novel fluid biomarkers (including BACE1, TREM2, YKL-40, IP-10, neurogranin, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, \\u03b1-synuclein, TDP-43, ferritin, VILIP-1, and NF-L) associated with each mechanism.

In the symptomatic phase, CSF A\\u03b242 levels remain fairly constant, with accompanied elevations of t-tau and p-tau, which are markers of neuronal injury. Notably, CSF A\\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau have been included in the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Along with amyloid positron emission tomography scans, they are presently used in the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients. The combination of these CSF biomarkers has resulted in improved sensitivity and specificity than when used alone and is able to predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Over the past ten years, several novel biomarkers of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathogenesis have been identified that can provide greater accuracy in diagnosis and prognosis in study cohorts and a better understanding of the neuropathologic changes during the development of the condition. The investigation of these novel CSF biomarkers and their association with the classical Alzheimer\\u2019s disease triad could signify further development in their clinical applications. Novel CSF biomarkers are necessary in order to advance the differential diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease with a satisfactory discriminating prospect for this condition compared with other neurodegenerative diseases. Levels of CSF hFABP and YKL-40 are suitable markers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and are able to discriminate it from other neurological conditions. Increased CSF YKL-40 predicts the progression from mild cognitive impairment to clinical Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and has been concomitant with humoral immunity. The association of novel biomarkers such as CSF MCP-1 and neurogranin with core biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau has improved their diagnostic accuracy for discriminating between Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. CSF MCP-1 and neurogranin are elevated in the early and late stages of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and are associated with an enhanced rate of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. They complement CSF A\\u03b242, p-tau, and t-tau protein levels, which make them possibly valuable biomarkers for monitoring the progression of the condition. Notably, they may be valuable additions as auxiliary tests to the current panel of core biomarkers; however, further validation is required in large clinical trials. Although CSF progranulin may be elevated during the progress of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and may add to its risk, further investigations are warranted to examine its potential for assessing disease severity and early detection. Likewise, CSF VILIP-1 is associated with p-tau and t-tau, which supports the principle that it is a biomarker of neuronal injury. Studies have shown that it is increased in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients compared with controls and is useful in discriminating Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other dementias. More longitudinal studies are needed to ascertain its ability to predict future cognitive loss in persons with normal cognitive function who develop the disease. Elevated CSF osteopontin and GAF levels are established in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment who subsequently develop the condition. The former test is a biomarker of the prodromal Alzheimer\\u2019s disease stage, and they are both beneficial for monitoring the disease. However, CSF GFAP does not have substantial discriminating potential, and further wide-scale studies are necessary to confirm these results.\",\n",

[153], however, pointed to potential reductions in CSF tau once subjects had passed their age of expected symptom onset. Additional studies in sporadic AD have reported supportive findings [161, 162]. Possibly, this may reflect a deceleration in neuronal injury or variations in the number of neurons being affected at a given disease stage [153]. At the MCI stage of AD, longitudinal findings over the course of a nearly 10-year period have shown that CSF levels of A\\u03b242 were decreased 5 to 10\\u00a0years prior to progression to AD dementia, whereas T-tau and P-tau appeared to be later markers as baseline levels were significantly higher in those who converted within the first 5\\u00a0years, as compared to those who converted between five and years [100]. Though longitudinal studies with serial sampling over extended periods are lacking, longitudinal findings over shorter intervals (e.g., 4\\u00a0years, with CSF sampled at three time points) have shown relative stability of CSF AD biomarkers [156, 163]. These studies also provided support for the hypothesis that tau follows A\\u03b2 pathology due the observation that low baseline A\\u03b242 values were associated with longitudinal increases in P-tau, but not the opposite. In line with this, Mattsson et al. recently showed that increases in CSF P-tau181 and P-tau217 appear to follow shortly after Amyloid PET [123].

Studies at this stage involve testing people and lead to diagnosis and treatment. Only preliminary evidence is available for the phase 4 aims. To determine the operating characteristic of the biomarker in a representative population by determining the true and false positive referral rates leading toward diagnosis and treatment. The primary aim of phase 4 is to determine the operating characteristics of the biomarker-based test in a real-world population by determining the detection and false referral rates. There is preliminary evidence for the phase 4 primary aim; longitudinal studies, however, are required for this aim to be fully achieved.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to the feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3].

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to the feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004).

In summary, trials with \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have clearly shown that CSF biomarkers can be used to verify drug-target engagement and a similar paradigm can be applied to other therapeutic strategies. There is evidence that adequate markers of target engagement might not necessarily capture disease-modifying effects (Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015). The theragnostic value of each biomarker should be individually assessed based on its association to cognitive or functional endpoints. To date, all drugs attempting to modify the course of AD have failed in their primary clinical endpoints. For this reason, it is difficult to address the question of whether CSF biomarkers can predict clinical response. In addition, the total number of patients with CSF measures in clinical trials is still low, further limiting the possibilities to draw firm conclusions. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as surrogate markers of disease modification and as indicators of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The trial with AN1792, the first active A\\u03b2 immunisation study showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo (Gilman et al. 2005). However, treatment with CAD106, another active immunotherapy, did not change the levels of Tau or pTau (Winblad et al. 2012). Most trials with passive immunisation have also included Tau markers in CSF in a subset of subjects. Treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels in both the phase II and phase III trials (Blennow et al. 2012; Salloway et al. 2014). However, this effect was not observed after treatment with solaneuzumab (Doody et al. 2014). These findings could be interpreted as if treatments that act on fibrillar A\\u03b2 have a greater impact on downstream neurodegeneration than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2 (Lleo et al. 2015). Results from ongoing studies with these and other anti-amyloid treatments might shed new biological evidence for the role of CSF markers to detect disease modification. In addition to Tau and pTau, other proteins have been investigated in CSF to monitor the pathophysiological pathways in AD. These novel biomarkers could provide further insights in clinical trials. Tau-independent markers of neuronal damage, such as NF-L, VLP-1, or the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, could give additional information about disease modification effects in trials with anti-Tau therapies, in which levels of total Tau and pTau could be the result of target engagement (Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Synaptic markers (NG, SNAP-25), markers of neuroinflammation/microglial activation (YKL-40 or CCL2) and markers of protein homeostasis and lysosomal dysfunction (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) could be used as indicators of disease progression (Alcolea et al. 2014; Cavedo et al. 2014; Alcolea et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Markers to detect common associated neuropathological comorbidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al.\",\n",

We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75 or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (7) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (85).

Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment.

The localized concentration of A\\u03b242 in synaptosomes from end-stage Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) brains can reach approximately 10 nM, sufficient to inhibit \\u03b3-secretase activity.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to the feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

Next, we tested whether human A\\u03b242 exerted inhibition on all members of the \\u03b3-secretase family \\u2013 i.e. irrespective of the type of PSEN (1 vs 2) and APH1 (A vs B) subunits (Figure 1D). Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238. We note that \\u03b3-secretase processes A\\u03b243 into A\\u03b240 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5\\u20131 \\u03bcM) (30). Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u03bcM A\\u03b242, for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C.

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Elevated intracellular A\\u03b242 levels promote \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, leading to increased accumulation of APP-CTFs (APP carboxy-terminal fragments). Oscillatory changes in \\u03b3-secretase activity can disrupt signaling pathways, affecting systems like NOTCH signaling implicated in memory. In end-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), A\\u03b242 can reach concentrations of ~10 nM in synaptosomes, sufficient to inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated substrate processing. This suggests a cyclical relationship between A\\u03b242 levels and \\u03b3-secretase activity, linking A\\u03b242 to neurodegeneration and clinical manifestations in AD.\\n\\n8\": {\n",

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to the feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and total tau levels in CSF, have been widely studied and are clinically relevant in diagnosing AD. Elevated Aβ42 levels in the presence of decreased Aβ40 are indicative of amyloid plaque formation, while increased tau levels correlate with neurodegeneration. These biomarkers can aid in identifying individuals at risk for AD and in stratifying patients for clinical trials targeting γ-secretase and Aβ metabolism (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024). By integrating biomarker data with clinical assessments, researchers can better understand the relationship between γ-secretase activity, Aβ metabolism, and disease progression in AD.\n",

A\\u03b2 has been the prime target for the development of AD therapy. However, the repeated failures of A\\u03b2-targeted clinical trials have cast considerable doubt on the amyloid cascade hypothesis and whether the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s drug has followed the correct course. However, the recent successes of A\\u03b2 targeted trials have assuaged those doubts. In this review, we discussed the evolution of the amyloid cascade hypothesis over the last 30 years and summarized its application in Alzheimer\\u2019s diagnosis and modification. In particular, we extensively discussed the pitfalls, promises and important unanswered questions regarding the current anti-A\\u03b2 therapy, as well as strategies for further study and development of more feasible A\\u03b2-targeted approaches in the optimization of AD prevention and treatment.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to progressive cognitive decline with pathological hallmarks of senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation in the brain. In 1984, Glenner & Wong discovered that the amyloid \\u03b2 protein (A\\u03b2) is the central component of extracellular amyloid plaques in AD.1 Since then, A\\u03b2 has been considered as a driver of Alzheimer\\u2019s pathological processes and the \\u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\\u201d has become a leading theory of AD pathogenesis.2 Over the past decades, targeting A\\u03b2 has been the main direction of developing AD treatment.3\\u20136 However, the repetitive failures of A\\u03b2-targeted clinical trials have cast considerable doubt on this hypothesis. Anti-A\\u03b2 therapy has now become a significant controversy in AD drug development and treatment. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential cleavage of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. However, the non-amyloidogenic pathway is the predominant pathway in vivo.7 APP is mostly cleaved first by \\u03b1-secretase within A\\u03b2 domain at the A\\u03b2 Leu17 site in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, generating a secreted form of APP (sAPP\\u03b1) and an 83-amino acid membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF) C83, thus precluding A\\u03b2 production. The beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the \\u03b2-secretase, and its homolog BACE2, the \\u03b8-secretase, also contribute to the non-amyloidogenic pathway.7,8 Under physiological conditions, BACE1 predominantly processes APP at the A\\u03b2 Glu11 \\u03b2-secretase site to generate C89, and \\u03b3-secretase cleaves C89 to produce a truncated A\\u03b211-40.7,8 BACE2 cleaves APP at the A\\u03b2 Phe20 \\u03b8-secretase site to generate C80 and precludes A\\u03b2 generation.9\\u201311 Two enzymatic cleavages of APP by\",\n",

These mice displayed reduced cerebral amyloid pathology, inhibited aberrant APP-A\\u03b2 metabolism by reducing \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases activity, and attenuated impairment of learning and memory compared with mAPP mice.

Previous clinical trials of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have failed, in large part due to the toxicity induced by lack of substrate-specific inhibition. Particularly notable is toxicity resulting from inhibition of Notch-1 cleavage, which disrupts essential signaling from this receptor.15,313 Thus, we should discover compounds that act as substrate-selective \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, which block the cleavage of C99, the immediate precursor of A\\u03b2, while allowing Notch cleavage to proceed unimpeded. Recently, a study showed that verteporfin only bound with the APP transmembrane domain rather than the transmembrane domain of the Notch-1 receptor, indicating its inhibitory effect is in a C99-specific manner.437 Our study also showed that PSEN1S169del (a deletion mutation in PSEN1 gene exon 6) has distinct effects on APP processing and Notch1 cleavage.39 This AD pathogenic mutation altered APP processing and A\\u03b2 generation without affecting Notch-1 cleavage and Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo. The results indicate that serine169 in PS1 could be a critical site as a potential target for the development of novel \\u03b3-secretase modulators without affecting Notch-1 cleavage to treat AD. A lack of selectivity is also a significant barrier to the therapeutic application of BACE1 inhibitors in AD. For instance, BACE2 is a close homolog of BACE1 but plays a neuroprotective role by inhibiting the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing7,8,10 and reducing potassium channel Kv2.1-induced neuronal apoptosis.438 Thus, a non-selective BACE1 inhibitor also inhibits BACE2\\u2019s protective functions, leading to off target side effects. Although the aspartyl protease family (e.g. BACE2, pepsin, renin, cathepsin D and cathepsin E) has conserved catalytic aspartic acid residues, the subsites in the active sites may be unique.439 Targeting these subsites to develop BACE1 inhibitors may increase their specificity. A\\u03b2-targeting antibodies also show off-target effects. A recent study identified that antibodies with Fc fragment reduced A\\u03b2 burden but also induced the engulgment of neuronal synapses by activating complement receptor 3 (CR3) or Fc\\u03b3 receptor IIB (Fc\\u03b3RIIB), which exacerbates cognitive impairment in AD mice.440 AD can be classified into a genetic and sporadic form of the disease.441 More than 99% of AD cases occur at an age >60 years in a sporadic manner, potentiated by various risk factors related to lifestyle.442 Less than 1% of all AD cases are early-onset with symptoms developed at an age of 50\\u2009s and earlier, and caused by gene mutations in APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2.7\",\n",

The presented two-substrate mechanism can explain how disruptions in the optimal balance between \\u03b3-secretase activity and A\\u03b2 metabolism can lead to toxic events in all different sporadic and FAD cases of the disease (Figure 9). A well-defined molecular mechanism that can connect different causes of the disease is crucial for the development of effective early diagnostic tools and drugs [19]. Drug development studies were among the first to indicate that \\u03b3-secretase has two substrate-binding sites [8,9,12,17,30]. Here, we show that the second substrate can affect the sites that bind different drugs (Supplementary Video S3). Such results are consistent with previous studies showing that a gradual increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate can affect how \\u03b3-secretase responds to drugs [6,7,9,11,12]. Drugs can lead to increases in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate [9,89]. Drugs, just like increasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase, can affect the A\\u03b2 (x-42)/A\\u03b2 (x-40) ratio [11,13]. FAD mutations can affect how drugs bind to \\u03b3-secretase [7,10]. Drugs, FAD mutations, and the second substrate can affect the most dynamic parts in the presenilin structure that control processive catalysis (Supplementary Videos S3 and S4). The presented insights indicate that the first possible improvement in future drug development strategies could be the development of competitive inhibitors of \\u03b3-secretase [19]. These competitive inhibitors could mimic the effects of the protective A673T mutation, i.e., decreasing the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate [15,19]. Attempts to design competitive inhibitors that target the active site have been challenging. The attempts to target the active site with peptide analogs have been unsuccessful due to the surprisingly long and flexible active site tunnel [8,9,12,23]. Our results indicate three alternative strategies for the development of competitive inhibitors: First, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to facilitate the closure of the nicastrin ectodomain (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). Second, the competitive inhibitors could compete with the formation of \\u03b2-secretase\\u2013\\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 8). Third, the competitive inhibitors could be designed to bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules and control its dimerization ([33,34,37] and Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 7). The development of compounds that target C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules is extremely difficult [39]. C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP has a highly dynamic structure and, thus, represents a poorly defined target for effective drug development efforts (Figure 1 and Figure 2 [33,34,37]). The prepared drugs have to compete with other molecules that bind to C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP with high affinity ([37] and Figure 1C). The second major improvement in drug development strategies could be an expansion of the future target list. Compounds that can decrease the catalytic capacity of \\u03b3-secretase can be used to trace different physiological processes that control \\u03b3-secretase activity and amyloid metabolism at pre-symptomatic stages of the disease (Figure 9). Briefly, compounds such as semagacestat and avagacestat can be used in healthy animals to gradually induce pathogenesis, by provoking gradual saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate (Figure 9 [7,9]). The induced pathogenic events can be used for the description of physiological processes that control cellular\",\n",

We analyze the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate using multiscale molecular dynamics studies. We found that an increase in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate could result in the parallel binding of different substrate molecules at the docking site and the active site. The C-terminal domain of the substrate bound at the docking site can interact with the most dynamic presenilin sites at the cytosolic end of the active site tunnel. Such interactions can inhibit the ongoing catalytic activity and increase the production of the longer, more hydrophobic, and more toxic A\\u03b2 proteins. Similar disruptions in dynamic presenilin structures can be observed with different drugs and disease-causing mutations. Both, C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and its different A\\u03b2 products, can support the toxic aggregation. The aggregation depends on the substrate N-terminal domain. Thus, the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b2-secretase path can be more toxic than the C83-\\u03b1CTF-APP substrate and \\u03b1-secretase path. Nicastrin can control the toxic aggregation in the closed conformation. The binding of the C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate to \\u03b3-secretase can be controlled by substrate channeling between the nicastrin and \\u03b2-secretase. We conclude that the presented two-substrate mechanism could explain the pathogenic changes in \\u03b3-secretase activity and A\\u03b2 metabolism in different sporadic and familial cases of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.

Alzheimer\\u2019s disease stands out among other malignant diseases as imposing the greatest financial burden on healthcare providers in developed countries [1,3,4]. Impressive drug development efforts have been mostly centered on the metabolism of the last 99 amino acids of the amyloid precursor protein (C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP) [3,4]. Based on strong genetic results, the most frequent therapeutic targets are two aspartic proteases: membrane-anchored \\u03b2-secretase, and membrane-embedded \\u03b3-secretase [2,3,5]. A number of different compounds have been developed. Compounds with different structures, different binding sites, different mechanisms of action, and different pharmacological properties have shown very impressive nanomolar potency [1,4,5]. This impressive list of diverse and potent compounds has not produced the desired results, but it clearly shows that the present challenges extend beyond routine medicinal chemistry. It appears that we need to address some unique features in the enzymatic mechanisms of \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase before we can develop successful drug design strategies [4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14].

Interestingly, it was also found in this study that the \\u03b3-byproducts accumulate in the membrane 103. This observation indicates that clearing the \\u03b3-byproducts from the membrane by facilitating their release into the hydrophilic space may be an additional function of \\u03b3-secretase. Semagacestat and other non-TSA GSIs may thus not inhibit the proteolytic activity of the enzyme but rather such a clearing function. One should note, however, that accumulation of \\u03b3-byproducts and long A\\u03b2 intermediates upon \\u03b3-secretase inhibition with DAPT has not been observed in reconstituted \\u03b3-secretase assays using detergent-solubilized enzyme 100152. This may be because such assays have only a simple and limited lipid composition compared to membrane-based cell-free assays with crude membrane fractions containing native \\u03b3-secretase 153154 in which accumulation of \\u03b3-byproducts is observed 103, and/or because residual detergent present in these assays keeps the \\u03b3-byproducts soluble. Further analysis is necessary to elucidate whether \\u03b3-secretase has such a putative \\u03b3-byproduct clearance activity, and if so, whether and how a potential malfunction could be involved in AD pathogenesis as intracellular buildup of \\u03b3-byproducts or in particular of longer A\\u03b2 in neurons may potentially cause membrane toxicity. Cleavage of C99 by \\u03b3-secretase causes the generation of secreted and intracellular A\\u03b2 pools as well as \\u03b3-byproducts from carboxy-terminal trimming of the C99 TMD. Unlike TSA-GSIs such as L-685,458, semagacestat causes an intracellular accumulation of long A\\u03b2 species and byproducts demonstrating a pseudo-inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by this and related compounds. Unfortunately, the failure of GSIs in major clinical trials since 2010 caused a discouragement of pharmaceutical companies that lead to a stop in drug development for this AD target. However, GSIs that went into the trials were developed when our understanding of the many functions of \\u03b3-secretase and of its cleavage mechanism was very limited. Clearly, as it turned out, pan-inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is highly problematic due to inhibition of critical substrates other than APP C99, potentially toxic C-terminal substrate fragment accumulation and A\\u03b2 rebound-effects from accumulated C99 155 as well as cross-reactivities with signal peptide peptidase and related protease family members 139. In addition, non-TSA GSIs that have been in clinical trials may paradoxically increase potentially toxic longer A\\u03b2 intermediates and \\u03b3-byproducts 103. Rather than GSIs, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) could be beneficial for AD.

However, it was halted in the Phase 2 study due to abnormal liver biochemistry values in four participants. Its toxicity was considered to be an off-target effect of the compound, which was not related to BACE1 inhibition (The 11th International Conference on Alzheimer\\u2019s & Parkinson\\u2019s Disease, 2013). Besides LY2886721, many other candidates have also reached late stages of clinical trials, including atabecestat (Phase 2/3),305 elenbecestat (Phase 3),306 lanabecestat (Phase 2/3)307,308 and umibecestat (Phase 2/3).309 However, all of them have failed to receive final approval to reach the market. Several obstacles have been found in the development of effective BACE1 inhibitors. BACE1 possesses structural similarities with many other aspartyl proteases, such as BACE2, pepsin, renin, cathepsin D and cathepsin E, a significant challenge to achieve the selectivity in BACE1 inhibition without affecting other proteases that cause off-target side effects.310 In addition, the size of the BACE1 active site is relatively large, including catalytic aspartic acid residues, flap, and 10\\u2009S loop.311 Since all the developed BACE1 inhibitors are small molecules, it may be difficult to occupy this large active site to efficiently block BACE1 activity. Low penetrance of blood-brain barrier (BBB) is also another concern.312 \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have been widely investigated as potential therapeutic approaches for AD due to their ability to inhibit A\\u03b2 production. However, the existing GSIs act too generally, which causes serious side effects through inhibiting the processing of other proteins, such as Notch, a transmembrane receptor involved in regulating cell-fate decisions.15,313 Thus, researchers have tried to develop a much more specific \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor, which only disrupts the production of A\\u03b2 but not others. Avagacestat is a recently developed arylsulfonamide \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor with high selectivity for APP over Notch, which successfully reduces CSF A\\u03b2 levels in the animal models without any Notch-related toxicity.314 Avagacestat was considered as a promising AD treatment with the ability to selectively inhibit the APP processing without affecting the Notch pathway.

Saturation can be a result of different mechanisms that lead to a decrease in the catalytic capacity of \\u03b3-secretase [7]. Changes in the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate can also significantly affect how the enzyme responds to potential drugs [6,9,11,12]. The earliest age of onset can be observed with mutants that have the best chance to reach saturation at the lowest substrate loads [7]. The protective islandic A673T mutation in the APP substrate is the only mutation that leads to a decrease in \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s saturation with its C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP substrate [15]. Control of the saturation of \\u03b3-secretase with its substrate can be a key physiological process [16]. The underlying mechanisms are still not understood [16]. Studies of the enzymatic mechanisms of \\u03b3-secretase have provided some surprising and fascinating insights about the disease, but they remain incomplete [17]. Frequent problems include inconsistent conclusions and irreproducible results. Accurate mechanistic interpretation depends on well-defined quantitative analysis [9,11,12,13]. Quantitative analysis of complex enzyme activity depends on accurate mathematical modeling [18,19,20,21,22], which can be challenging for complex enzymes [9,12,20]. Fortunately, computational studies of molecular structures can greatly simplify and advance interpretations of enzyme activity studies [8,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. We use advanced computational methods and \\u03b3-secretase structures to address some of the open questions in mechanistic studies of \\u03b3-secretase activity [7,9,10,11,13,30,31]. We found that \\u03b3-secretase can bind two different substrate molecules in parallel\\u2014one at the docking site and one at the active site [17,29,30]. The second substrate binds to the most dynamic sites in \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s structure that can be affected by disease-causing FAD mutations and by different drugs. The presented two-substrate mechanism can explain many of the pathogenic changes in \\u03b3-secretase activity at the molecular structural level. The presented molecular mechanism can be used for building correlations between different enzyme-based, cell-based, animal, and clinical studies of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [3,5,7,9,10,32]. Such correlations are crucial for the development of effective early diagnostic tools and drug development strategies [4]. C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules have highly dynamic structures that can be readily affected by the experimental conditions and can be difficult to measure [3,27,33,34,35,36,37]. We used multiscale MD studies to capture possible interactions between C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP molecules in a cholesterol\\u2013lipid bilayer (Figure 1 and Figure 2) [38]. We started all MD studies by building a full-length C99-\\u03b2CTF-APP structure from the available NMR conformers (PDB: 2LP1 [33]; see Materials and Methods). The soluble N-terminal and C-terminal ends can readily fold into compact structures even when calculations start with the fully extended structures (Supplementary Video S1).

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) is triggering the disease. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavages of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. The latter cleavage by \\u03b3-secretase, a unique and fascinating four-component protease complex, occurs in the APP transmembrane domain thereby releasing A\\u03b2 species of 37-43 amino acids in length including the longer, highly pathogenic peptides A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243. The lack of a precise understanding of A\\u03b2 generation as well as of the functions of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key AD drug target in the past few years. Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the \\u03b3-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes \\u03b2-secretase cleaved APP into different A\\u03b2 species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the \\u03b3-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of A\\u03b242/43. Finally, we discuss how the knowledge emerging from these studies could be used to therapeutically target this enzyme in a safe way.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u00b4s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide currently affecting about 47 millions people. The disease affects the elderly typically above an age of ~65 and manifests with progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline. About a third of the people at an age of 85 are diagnosed with AD. Aging is thus the most important risk factor for the disease. In very rare cases, AD can also be genetically inherited. These familial forms of AD (FAD) are typically characterized by a much earlier onset of the disease below 65 years, which can occur in very aggressive forms already in adolescence. To date, there is no therapy available that can prevent the disease or cure it 1. Pathologically, AD is characterized by a massive deposition of abnormal protein aggregates present as extracellular plaques of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide (A\\u03b2) in the brain parenchyma and as neurofibrillary tangles, intraneuronal deposits composed of the microtubule binding protein tau 2. In addition, dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads of tau are commonly observed in AD. It is widely believed that abnormal levels of A\\u03b2 trigger the disease 3. A\\u03b2 is a small hydrophobic ~4 kDa peptide, which is derived by sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a single pass transmembrane protein with type I topology which is expressed in neurons\",\n",

Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \"bidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238. We note that \\u03b3-secretase processes A\\u03b243 into A\\u03b240 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5\\u20131 \\u03bcM) (30). Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u03bcM A\\u03b242, for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (5, 6), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatment with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (7), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (8\\u201312). The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing\",\n",

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

Each biomarker category is rated as normal (relative to the A) or abnormal (+). Individual scores might appear as A+ T\\u2212N+, or A+ T\\u2212N\\u2212, etc. Individuals with an A\\u2212T +N\\u2212, A\\u2212T\\u2212N + or A\\u2212T+N+ fall under the original definition of SNAP (Jack et al. 2012). The ATN classification construct will enable researchers to examine multi-modality biomarker associations where the effects of tauopathy and neurodegeneration/neuronal injury are segregated in individuals who meet criteria for SNAP (Figure 7). From a regulatory perspective, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepts both the IWG and the NIA-AA sets of criteria for diagnosis of AD, for research purposes, and for trial enrichment. The current position of EMA on the diagnostic guidelines is summarised in a draft guidance recently published (EMA 2016). This guideline follows the view that considers AD a pathophysiological continuum with a long-term pre-symptomatic stage preceding many years the clinical manifestation. The aim of the above-cited EMA/CHMP draft guideline was to evaluate, among others, the impact of new diagnostic criteria for AD, taking into consideration also the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic disease stages on clinical trial design; and the use of biomarkers in the different phases of drug development. However, adequate standardisation and validation of biomarkers for regulatory purposes is still lacking (Noel-Storr et al. 2013; Dubois et al. 2014). This also reflects the continuous advances in the diagnostic area of research. In this frame, a step forward is represented by the recent approval in the EU of the radio-pharmaceuticals 18F-florbetapir, 18F-florbetaben and 18F-flutemetamol for PET imaging of A\\u03b2 plaques in the brain. These diagnostic ligands are used in patients evaluated for AD, following an accurate clinical assessment versus other forms of cognitive impairment; their usefulness is being investigated in large observational cohorts. Besides PET, also CSF biomarkers are currently considered, although it is recommended to measure multiple parameters such as A\\u03b21\\u201342, total Tau or its hyperphosphorylated form (Hampel et al. 2014; Medina and Avila 2014). While the core clinical criteria still remain fundamental, biomarkers may increase the specificity of diagnosis (Hampel et al. 2014). Unquestionably, standardisation and harmonisation in their use for early diagnosis of AD along the development of clinical trials needs continuous adjustment. In this context, validation of reliable and sensitive instruments to measure cognitive, functional, behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms especially in early disease stages are strongly encouraged by EMA and other regulatory bodies. The growing use of CSF biomarkers in clinical practice and research studies has had an impact on clinical trials that have incorporated them, assisting in participant selection and monitoring of target engagement. Furthermore, they have the potential to demonstrate evidence of disease modification. It is anticipated that the standardisation of pre-analytical and analytical conditions, together with the implementation of fully automated assays of\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zhang et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and total tau levels in CSF, have been widely studied and are clinically relevant in diagnosing AD. Elevated Aβ42 levels in the presence of decreased Aβ40 are indicative of amyloid plaque formation, while increased tau levels correlate with neurodegeneration. These biomarkers can aid in identifying individuals at risk for AD and in stratifying patients for clinical trials targeting γ-secretase and Aβ metabolism (McGrowder et al., 2021; Zoltowska et al., 2024). By integrating biomarker data with clinical assessments, researchers can better understand the relationship between γ-secretase activity, Aβ metabolism, and disease progression in AD.\n",

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

In summary, trials with \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have clearly shown that CSF biomarkers can be used to verify drug-target engagement and a similar paradigm can be applied to other therapeutic strategies. There is evidence that adequate markers of target engagement might not necessarily capture disease-modifying effects (Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015). The theragnostic value of each biomarker should be individually assessed based on its association to cognitive or functional endpoints. To date, all drugs attempting to modify the course of AD have failed in their primary clinical endpoints. For this reason, it is difficult to address the question of whether CSF biomarkers can predict clinical response. In addition, the total number of patients with CSF measures in clinical trials is still low, further limiting the possibilities to draw firm conclusions. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as surrogate markers of disease modification and as indicators of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The trial with AN1792, the first active A\\u03b2 immunisation study showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo (Gilman et al. 2005). However, treatment with CAD106, another active immunotherapy, did not change the levels of Tau or pTau (Winblad et al. 2012). Most trials with passive immunisation have also included Tau markers in CSF in a subset of subjects. Treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels in both the phase II and phase III trials (Blennow et al. 2012; Salloway et al. 2014). However, this effect was not observed after treatment with solaneuzumab (Doody et al. 2014). These findings could be interpreted as if treatments that act on fibrillar A\\u03b2 have a greater impact on downstream neurodegeneration than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2 (Lleo et al. 2015). Results from ongoing studies with these and other anti-amyloid treatments might shed new biological evidence for the role of CSF markers to detect disease modification. In addition to Tau and pTau, other proteins have been investigated in CSF to monitor the pathophysiological pathways in AD. These novel biomarkers could provide further insights in clinical trials. Tau-independent markers of neuronal damage, such as NF-L, VLP-1, or the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, could give additional information about disease modification effects in trials with anti-Tau therapies, in which levels of total Tau and pTau could be the result of target engagement (Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Synaptic markers (NG, SNAP-25), markers of neuroinflammation/microglial activation (YKL-40 or CCL2) and markers of protein homeostasis and lysosomal dysfunction (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) could be used as indicators of disease progression (Alcolea et al. 2014; Cavedo et al. 2014; Alcolea et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Markers to detect common associated neuropathological comorbidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al.\",\n",

Additionally, active immunization studies highlighted that \\\"antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels\\\" compared to placebo groups.

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

Additionally, the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 is reversible. The N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 is crucial to the inhibitory mechanism, with truncated variants showing reduced potency and diminished inhibitory effects compared to full-length A\\u03b242.

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

Our analysis of the global \\u03b3-secretase (endopeptidase) activity in well-controlled cell-free assays, using purified protease and substrate, demonstrated that human A\\u03b242 inhibited the processing of APPC99 by all members of the human \\u03b3-secretase family. Notably, despite the high homology between human and murine A\\u03b2 sequences, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 failed to inhibit the proteolysis of APPC99, implying that structural determinants in the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 are involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Consistent with this view, N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b211\\u201342 and p3 17\\u201342) demonstrated reduced or no inhibitory properties, compared to human A\\u03b242. The p3 peptides lack the 16 amino acids long, hydrophilic, and disordered N-terminal domain present in A\\u03b2, but do contain the two aggregation-prone regions (16\\u201321 and 29\\u201342) required for the assembly of oligomers (Festa, 2019; Dulin et al., 2008) and fibrils (Higgins et al., 1996; L\\u00f3pez de la Paz and Serrano, 2004; Kuhn et al., 2020). Despite p3 peptides\\u2019 aggregation-prone behavior (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020) and their accumulation in AD brain (Higgins et al., 1996; Saido et al., 1996; Lalowski et al., 1996; Gowing et al., 1994), the neurotoxicity of these peptides is not well defined (Walsh et al., 2002). Moreover, our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter A\\u03b21-x species (x=37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human A\\u03b242. The reported lower affinities of shorter A\\u03b2 peptides towards \\u03b3-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (Szaruga et al., 2017). Our analysis on cultured neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human A\\u03b242, but not p3, resulted in the accumulation of \\u03b3-secretase substrates. This phenotype is consistent with an A\\u03b242-induced inhibitory effect on \\u03b3-secretase activity, but could also be a consequence of alterations in cellular mechanisms that define protein (substrate) steady-state levels. However, A\\u03b242 treatment did not induce significant cellular toxicity, as determined by two independent readouts, nor did it promote APP-CTF generation, as indicated by the analysis of total, soluble APP ectodomain (precursor) levels. In addition, the assessment of the APP-CTF turnover by \\u03b3-secretase and/or general degradation mechanisms defined the inhibition of endogenous \\u03b3-secretases as the most important mechanism contributing to the accumulation of APP-CTF in living neurons treated with human A\\u03b242. Intriguingly, despite their common inhibitory effects in cell-free conditions, only human A\\u03b242 and no other A\\u03b2 peptides induced the accumulation of unprocessed APP-CTFs in cells. Reports showing that A\\u03b2 conformation affects both cellular internalization and neurotoxicity (Vadukul et al., 2020) motivated us to test the possibility that A\\u03b242, unlike other A\\u03b2 peptides, acquires specific conformations that promote its endocytosis and/or inhibit its intracellular degradation.

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75 or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (7) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (85). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (86-89), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (90). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3secretase activity that we propose.

Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020).

It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

Our analysis of the global \\u03b3-secretase (endopeptidase) activity in well-controlled cell-free assays, using purified protease and substrate, demonstrated that human A\\u03b242 inhibited the processing of APPC99 by all members of the human \\u03b3-secretase family. Notably, despite the high homology between human and murine A\\u03b2 sequences, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 failed to inhibit the proteolysis of APPC99, implying that structural determinants in the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 are involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Consistent with this view, N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b211\\u201342 and p3 17\\u201342) demonstrated reduced or no inhibitory properties, compared to human A\\u03b242. The p3 peptides lack the 16 amino acids long, hydrophilic, and disordered N-terminal domain present in A\\u03b2, but do contain the two aggregation-prone regions (16\\u201321 and 29\\u201342) required for the assembly of oligomers (Festa, 2019; Dulin et al., 2008) and fibrils (Higgins et al., 1996; L\\u00f3pez de la Paz and Serrano, 2004; Kuhn et al., 2020). Despite p3 peptides\\u2019 aggregation-prone behavior (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020) and their accumulation in AD brain (Higgins et al., 1996; Saido et al., 1996; Lalowski et al., 1996; Gowing et al., 1994), the neurotoxicity of these peptides is not well defined (Walsh et al., 2002). Moreover, our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter A\\u03b21-x species (x=37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human A\\u03b242. The reported lower affinities of shorter A\\u03b2 peptides towards \\u03b3-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (Szaruga et al., 2017). Our analysis on cultured neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human A\\u03b242, but not p3, resulted in the accumulation of \\u03b3-secretase substrates. This phenotype is consistent with an A\\u03b242-induced inhibitory effect on \\u03b3-secretase activity, but could also be a consequence of alterations in cellular mechanisms that define protein (substrate) steady-state levels. However, A\\u03b242 treatment did not induce significant cellular toxicity, as determined by two independent readouts, nor did it promote APP-CTF generation, as indicated by the analysis of total, soluble APP ectodomain (precursor) levels. In addition, the assessment of the APP-CTF turnover by \\u03b3-secretase and/or general degradation mechanisms defined the inhibition of endogenous \\u03b3-secretases as the most important mechanism contributing to the accumulation of APP-CTF in living neurons treated with human A\\u03b242.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242. The IC50 values for A\\u03b211\\u201342 were reduced 1.79- and 1.31-fold (KM and saturating substrate concentrations, respectively), relative to A\\u03b242 (Figure 2B,\\nSupplementary file 1a), while the larger N-terminal truncation (of residues 1\\u201316) even further reduced the inhibitory effect to the level seen with murine A\\u03b242 (Figure 2C). Collectively, these data assign a defining role to the N-terminal region of A\\u03b2 in the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity.

The concentration of A\\u03b242 in synaptosomes from end-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) is around 10 nM, sufficient to inhibit \\u03b3-secretase activity in experimental models (PC12 cells). This cyclic mechanism suggests that increased A\\u03b242 leads to \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, reducing signaling pathways vital for neuronal function.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

However, APP substrate is proteolyzed processively by \\u03b3-secretase along two pathways: A\\u03b249\\u2192A\\u03b246\\u2192A\\u03b243\\u2192A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b248\\u2192A\\u03b245\\u2192A\\u03b242\\u2192A\\u03b238. Effects of FAD mutations on each proteolytic step are unknown, largely due to difficulties in detecting and quantifying longer A\\u03b2 peptides. To address this, we carried out systematic and quantitative analyses of all tri- and tetrapeptide coproducts from proteolysis of wild-type and 14 FAD-mutant APP substrates by purified \\u03b3-secretase. These small peptides, including FAD-mutant forms, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by establishing concentration curves for each of 32 standards.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and total tau levels in CSF, have been widely studied and are clinically relevant in diagnosing AD. Elevated Aβ42 levels in the presence of decreased Aβ40 are indicative of amyloid plaque formation, while increased tau levels correlate with neurodegeneration. These biomarkers can aid in identifying individuals at risk for AD and in stratifying patients for clinical trials targeting γ-secretase and Aβ metabolism (Zoltowska et al., 2024). By integrating biomarker data with clinical assessments, researchers can better understand the relationship between γ-secretase activity, Aβ metabolism, and disease progression in AD.\n",

As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75 or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (7) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (85). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (86-89), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (90). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis.\\u201d We have also added figures 10C and 10D, presented here for convenience.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023).

Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM).

Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u03bcM A\\u03b242, for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included.

We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular -homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) (1). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (5, 6), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatment with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (7), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (8\\u201312). The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

In summary, trials with \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have clearly shown that CSF biomarkers can be used to verify drug-target engagement and a similar paradigm can be applied to other therapeutic strategies. There is evidence that adequate markers of target engagement might not necessarily capture disease-modifying effects (Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015). The theragnostic value of each biomarker should be individually assessed based on its association to cognitive or functional endpoints. To date, all drugs attempting to modify the course of AD have failed in their primary clinical endpoints. For this reason, it is difficult to address the question of whether CSF biomarkers can predict clinical response. In addition, the total number of patients with CSF measures in clinical trials is still low, further limiting the possibilities to draw firm conclusions. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as surrogate markers of disease modification and as indicators of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The trial with AN1792, the first active A\\u03b2 immunisation study showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo (Gilman et al. 2005). However, treatment with CAD106, another active immunotherapy, did not change the levels of Tau or pTau (Winblad et al. 2012). Most trials with passive immunisation have also included Tau markers in CSF in a subset of subjects. Treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels in both the phase II and phase III trials (Blennow et al. 2012; Salloway et al. 2014). However, this effect was not observed after treatment with solaneuzumab (Doody et al. 2014). These findings could be interpreted as if treatments that act on fibrillar A\\u03b2 have a greater impact on downstream neurodegeneration than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2 (Lleo et al. 2015). Results from ongoing studies with these and other anti-amyloid treatments might shed new biological evidence for the role of CSF markers to detect disease modification. In addition to Tau and pTau, other proteins have been investigated in CSF to monitor the pathophysiological pathways in AD. These novel biomarkers could provide further insights in clinical trials. Tau-independent markers of neuronal damage, such as NF-L, VLP-1, or the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, could give additional information about disease modification effects in trials with anti-Tau therapies, in which levels of total Tau and pTau could be the result of target engagement (Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Synaptic markers (NG, SNAP-25), markers of neuroinflammation/microglial activation (YKL-40 or CCL2) and markers of protein homeostasis and lysosomal dysfunction (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) could be used as indicators of disease progression (Alcolea et al. 2014; Cavedo et al. 2014; Alcolea et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Markers to detect common associated neuropathological comorbidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al.\",\n",

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

      "    \"summary: Trials with \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including total Tau and phosphorylated Tau (pTau), are useful for verifying drug-target engagement in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence suggests that while some treatments targeting fibrillar A\\u03b2 are linked to reduced CSF total Tau levels\\u2014such as the AN1792 trial\\u2014others, like CAD106, showed no change. The findings imply that treatments on fibrillar A\\u03b2 may affect downstream neurodegeneration more than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2. Additionally, markers like neurofilament light chain (NF-L) and neuroinflammation markers may provide insights into disease modification.\\n\\n9\": {\n",

In summary, trials with \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have clearly shown that CSF biomarkers can be used to verify drug-target engagement and a similar paradigm can be applied to other therapeutic strategies. There is evidence that adequate markers of target engagement might not necessarily capture disease-modifying effects (Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015). The theragnostic value of each biomarker should be individually assessed based on its association to cognitive or functional endpoints. To date, all drugs attempting to modify the course of AD have failed in their primary clinical endpoints. For this reason, it is difficult to address the question of whether CSF biomarkers can predict clinical response. In addition, the total number of patients with CSF measures in clinical trials is still low, further limiting the possibilities to draw firm conclusions. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as surrogate markers of disease modification and as indicators of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The trial with AN1792, the first active A\\u03b2 immunisation study showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo (Gilman et al. 2005). However, treatment with CAD106, another active immunotherapy, did not change the levels of Tau or pTau (Winblad et al. 2012). Most trials with passive immunisation have also included Tau markers in CSF in a subset of subjects. Treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels in both the phase II and phase III trials (Blennow et al. 2012; Salloway et al. 2014). However, this effect was not observed after treatment with solaneuzumab (Doody et al. 2014). These findings could be interpreted as if treatments that act on fibrillar A\\u03b2 have a greater impact on downstream neurodegeneration than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2 (Lleo et al. 2015). Results from ongoing studies with these and other anti-amyloid treatments might shed new biological evidence for the role of CSF markers to detect disease modification. In addition to Tau and pTau, other proteins have been investigated in CSF to monitor the pathophysiological pathways in AD. These novel biomarkers could provide further insights in clinical trials. Tau-independent markers of neuronal damage, such as NF-L, VLP-1, or the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, could give additional information about disease modification effects in trials with anti-Tau therapies, in which levels of total Tau and pTau could be the result of target engagement (Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Synaptic markers (NG, SNAP-25), markers of neuroinflammation/microglial activation (YKL-40 or CCL2) and markers of protein homeostasis and lysosomal dysfunction (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) could be used as indicators of disease progression (Alcolea et al. 2014; Cavedo et al. 2014; Alcolea et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Markers to detect common associated neuropathological comorbidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al.\",\n",

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

This results in synaptic loss, neuronal loss (notably, the temporoparietal association cortices and medial temporal lobe structures), memory impairment, and enhanced cognitive dysfunction due to progressive neuronal degeneration [17,18]. There are two types of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, classified according to pathological factors and the age of commencement. Early-onset or familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is multifactorial and has a sporadic occurrence. These patients usually present with other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 1and 2), obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome [2]. In the second type\\u2014late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease\\u2014there is an elevation of A\\u03b242 fragment levels, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and excitotoxicity. The pathological process of late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease involves mitochondrial damage of neurons, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the vascular endothelium [19]. Existing biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease include (1) A\\u03b242 (the 42 amino acid form of amyloid \\u03b2) in CSF and (2) total and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF [20]. The utilization of these biomarkers, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, contribute to the early detection of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, with higher diagnostic certainty [21]. The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) system, a biomarker-based biological classification, was published in 2018 by a work group commissioned by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association [22]. There is a reference to A (representing amyloid plaques) and T (tau neurofibrillary tangles); these biomarkers are precise neuropathological indicators of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The \\u03b2-amyloid biomarker is assessed by measuring CSF A\\u03b242 levels using immunoassays for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry or detection of amyloid PET [23]. Phosphorylated tau has been measured extensively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or detected on tau positron emission tomography (PET) [24]. N represents biomarkers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration, which are assessed by measuring total tau in CSF by ELISA or atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; the latter not regarded as disease-specific [25].

In a recent study, McKeever et al. examined miRNA expression profiles in CSF-derived exosomes from young-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (YOAD) and late-onset (LOAD) patients [279]. There were decreased expressions of miR-605-5p, miR-16-5p, and miR-451a and upregulation of miR-125b-5p in YOAD patients compared to controls. In the cohort patients with LOAD, there was increased expression of miR-125b-5p and downregulation of miR-605-5p and miR-451a compared to controls [279]. The authors suggested that these miRNAs signify novel targets for unraveling the mechanism of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and the development of potential biomarkers, particularly exosomal miR-16-5p, which is related to YOAD [279]. Significant research is currently being pursued in the area of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarkers; future directions involve the discovery of biomarkers that can evaluate the entire continuum of disease pathogenesis and enable accurate diagnosis in the early stages of the condition. Laboratory assays for blood-based Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarkers are presently being developed, and they may be of assistance in monitoring asymptomatic persons and diagnosing those who are symptomatic. The challenges of lower concentrations of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarkers in the plasma compared with CSF, a more complex matrix, as well as analytical and biological variabilities need to be addressed. Clinical-grade assays on automatic platforms used in the measurement of plasma biomarkers need to be properly validated. There is recently published literature on the use of immune-magnetic reduction assays and single-molecule array technology for plasma-based Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarker measurement [438]. Furthermore, modern advances in the development of proteomics, metabolomics, mass spectrometry, and the use of exosomes have shown significant possibilities for blood-based biomarkers as screening tools for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Beyond the core CSF biomarkers, there are other analytes associated with amyloidogenesis and/or A\\u03b2 metabolism, neuroinflammation, and pathological oxidative changes that have shown potential and are worth future investigation. A\\u03b2 oligomers in blood and CSF have been determined by the use of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). There are many methodological challenges, and, recently, there have been reports on improved methods for measuring A\\u03b2 oligomers and pathological misfolded tau. The protein misfolding cyclic amplification assay is extremely sensitive in identifying A\\u03b2 oligomers in the CSF of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients [280]. In the last few years, a real-time quaking-induced conversion assay has been employed in the ultrasensitive detection of tau aggregates that provides molecular evidence of tau filament propagation in the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [439]. Although these molecular protocols are ultrasensitive and improve the detection of CSF biomarkers, there is a need for method validation and measurement of both A\\u03b2 oligomers and tau aggregates in clinical studies with large populations of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients.

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020).

It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Publications that were not in English were excluded due to the challenges of evaluating the contents as accessible open resources. The most relevant or primary studies were included in this analysis, and replicated contents were omitted along with studies with a small sample size (Figure 1). Studies with important findings of key CSF biomarkers are included in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Of note, key findings of meta-analysis articles are given in Table 1. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44].

Notably, p-tau/A\\u03b242 (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 100%) was a good discriminator of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other dementia syndromes [36] (Table 1). Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141].

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019). (A) The scheme depicts the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) and p3 peptides. The N-terminal sequence of APPC99 /A\\u03b2 is shown in the lower panel. The differences in the amino acid sequence of human (hu) vs murine (mu) A\\u03b2 peptides and the positions of \\u03b2\\u2019- and \\u03b1-cleavages (that precede the generation of A\\u03b211\\u201342 and p3 17\\u201342 peptides, respectively) are indicated.

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and total tau levels in CSF, have been widely studied and are clinically relevant in diagnosing AD. Elevated Aβ42 levels in the presence of decreased Aβ40 are indicative of amyloid plaque formation, while increased tau levels correlate with neurodegeneration. These biomarkers can aid in identifying individuals at risk for AD and in stratifying patients for clinical trials targeting γ-secretase and Aβ metabolism (Lewczuk et al., 2017). By integrating biomarker data with clinical assessments, researchers can better understand the relationship between γ-secretase activity, Aβ metabolism, and disease progression in AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers such as CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, and tau levels have been shown to correlate with disease progression and cognitive decline in AD patients. The clinical relevance of these biomarkers lies in their ability to facilitate early diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and evaluate the response to therapeutic interventions. For GSEC-targeted therapies, these biomarkers could be instrumental in stratifying patients based on their baseline Aβ profiles and predicting treatment responses, thereby enhancing the precision of clinical trials and therapeutic applications.\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4.

In 1984, Glenner & Wong discovered that the amyloid \\u03b2 protein (A\\u03b2) is the central component of extracellular amyloid plaques in AD.1 Since then, A\\u03b2 has been considered as a driver of Alzheimer\\u2019s pathological processes and the \\u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\\u201d has become a leading theory of AD pathogenesis.2 Over the past decades, targeting A\\u03b2 has been the main direction of developing AD treatment.3\\u20136 However, the repetitive failures of A\\u03b2-targeted clinical trials have cast considerable doubt on this hypothesis. Anti-A\\u03b2 therapy has now become a significant controversy in AD drug development and treatment. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential cleavage of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. However, the non-amyloidogenic pathway is the predominant pathway in vivo.7 APP is mostly cleaved first by \\u03b1-secretase within A\\u03b2 domain at the A\\u03b2 Leu17 site in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, generating a secreted form of APP (sAPP\\u03b1) and an 83-amino acid membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF) C83, thus precluding A\\u03b2 production. The beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the \\u03b2-secretase, and its homolog BACE2, the \\u03b8-secretase, also contribute to the non-amyloidogenic pathway.7,8 Under physiological conditions, BACE1 predominantly processes APP at the A\\u03b2 Glu11 \\u03b2-secretase site to generate C89, and \\u03b3-secretase cleaves C89 to produce a truncated A\\u03b211-40.7,8 BACE2 cleaves APP at the A\\u03b2 Phe20 \\u03b8-secretase site to generate C80 and precludes A\\u03b2 generation.9\\u201311 Two enzymatic cleavages of APP by\",\n",

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4]. While the underlying disease mechanisms are complex and still being elucidated, multiple lines of evidence support the \\u201camyloid hypothesis,\\u201d which posits that the accumulation of A\\u03b2 peptides initiates a chain of pathological events, including formation of neurofibrillary tangles and inflammatory responses, leading to widespread neurodegeneration and ultimately AD [5, 6].

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020).

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Created with BioRender.com Mutations in PS1 and PS2 have been linked to early-onset familial AD. To date more than 300 mutations for PS1 and PS2 have been reported [29, 30]. While the mechanism by which these mutations cause FAD pathogenesis has been widely investigated, two theories have been proposed: the amyloid hypothesis and the presenilin hypothesis. The amyloid hypothesis suggests that PS1 and PS2 FAD increase A\\u03b242 production, which leads to neuronal cell death and dementia. These mutations are observed to increase the ratio of A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 [31]; the relative increase in A\\u03b242 production is more prone to aggregation and formation of amyloid fibrils in the brain [28]. The presenilin hypothesis suggests that loss of presenilin function in the brain triggers FAD. Presenilin was demonstrated as essential for learning, memory, and neuronal survival [32]. \\u03b3-Secretase is regulated by many intricate mechanisms, ranging from the assembly of active and mature complexes to spatial compartmentalization and lipid composition [33, 34]. Because only a small fraction of \\u03b3-secretase complexes are catalytically active [35], it was hypothesized that other co-factors could stimulate the inactive pool of \\u03b3-secretase. Discoveries of \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins (GSMPs), non-essential subunits which can bind to and modulate \\u03b3-secretase in response to cellular and environmental changes, have added an interesting layer of regulation [33, 34]. Multiple studies have identified GSMPs which regulate \\u03b3-secretase activity and substrate specificity and are dependent on specific contexts: GSAP by aging [36, 37], IFITM3 by innate immunity and aging [38], Hif-1\\u03b1 by hypoxia [39], and SERP1 by ER stress [40].

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular -homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) (1). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4).

It is noteworthy that treatment with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (7), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (8\\u201312). The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits.

The cleavage of APP occurs at various sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6, \\u03b3, and \\u03b3\\u2032) within the membrane, producing peptides of different lengths, primarily A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242. A\\u03b242, considered highly pathogenic, has a greater propensity for aggregation compared to A\\u03b240. The mechanism of \\u03b3-secretase activity can be influenced by mutations; for instance, the Icelandic mutation (A673T) reduces \\u03b2-secretase cleavage and thereby decreases amyloidogenic fragments by approximately 40%. \\n\\n9\": {\n",

Until so far, no mutations have been found in \\u03b2-secretase, but the Swedish and the Leuven APP mutations are known to shift the cleavage from the \\u03b2\\u2032-site to the \\u03b2-site, thus leading to a much higher C99 and A\\u03b2 production (12, 13, 37, 38). Inversely, the Icelandic mutation (A673T) seems to be protective against AD by decreasing \\u03b2-secretase cleavage and thus reducing by 40% the amyloidogenic fragments sAPP\\u03b2 and A\\u03b2 (17, 39). The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50). Further studies also revealed a very complex cleavage of APP-CTFs by \\u03b3-secretase, since it takes place within the membrane and successively at several sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6-, \\u03b3- and \\u03b3\\u2032). The first endopeptidase cleavage (\\u025b-cleavage) can occur at two distinct sites leading to the generation of A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249, which is then shortened by sequential carboxypeptidase cleavages (trimming) at \\u03b6, \\u03b3-and \\u03b3\\u2032-sites, occurring at each three or four residues and via two distinct product lines (A\\u03b249 > A\\u03b246 > A\\u03b243 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b237) or (A\\u03b248 > A\\u03b245 > A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b238) and the final occurrence of peptides of varying lengths but two major species of 40 or 42 amino acid residues, respectively (51).

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242.

In this context, a bulk of efforts have aimed at developing therapeutic strategies seeking to reduce A\\u03b2 levels, either by blocking its production (\\u03b3- and \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors) or by neutralizing it once formed (A\\u03b2-directed immunotherapies). However, so far the vast majority of, if not all, clinical trials based on these strategies have failed, since they have not been able to restore cognitive function in AD patients, and even in many cases, they have worsened the clinical picture. We here propose that AD could be more complex than a simple A\\u03b2-linked pathology and discuss the possibility that a way to reconcile undoubted genetic evidences linking processing of APP to AD and a consistent failure of A\\u03b2-based clinical trials could be to envision the pathological contribution of the direct precursor of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b2-secretase-derived C-terminal fragment of APP, \\u03b2CTF, also referred to as C99. In this review, we summarize scientific evidences pointing to C99 as an early contributor to AD and postulate that \\u03b3-secretase should be considered as not only an A\\u03b2-generating protease, but also a beneficial C99-inactivating enzyme. In that sense, we discuss the limitations of molecules targeting \\u03b3-secretase and propose alternative strategies seeking to reduce C99 levels by other means and notably by enhancing its lysosomal degradation.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent age-related neurodegenerative disease. After initial clinical characterization, histopathological analysis revealed the presence of two major anatomical lesions signing this pathology: senile plaques that are extracellular protein aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles that are intracellular neuronal lesions (1, 2, 3). Senile plaques are mainly composed of the small 4\\u00a0kDa amyloid beta peptide (A\\u03b2) (4) and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated and cleaved forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (5, 6). The cloning of the A\\u03b2 precursor, the \\u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in the late 80s was a key step in the understanding of the pathology. APP was found to be localized on chromosome 21 (7), thus explaining the development of early-onset dementia and the presence of senile plaques in Down syndrome patients carrying an extra copy of APP due to a duplication of this chromosome (8). Furthermore, the identification of APP mutations responsible for autosomal dominant form of AD (FAD), including the \\u201cDutch\\u201d (9) \\u201cLondon\\u201d (10) and \\u201cSwedish\\u201d mutations (11), showed that the functional consequences of these mutations were to augment the load of A\\u03b2 and/or to shift A\\u03b2 production to more aggregating A\\u03b2 peptides (12, 13).

Moreover, our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter A\\u03b21-x species (x=37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human A\\u03b242. The reported lower affinities of shorter A\\u03b2 peptides towards \\u03b3-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (Szaruga et al., 2017). Our analysis on cultured neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human A\\u03b242, but not p3, resulted in the accumulation of \\u03b3-secretase substrates. This phenotype is consistent with an A\\u03b242-induced inhibitory effect on \\u03b3-secretase activity, but could also be a consequence of alterations in cellular mechanisms that define protein (substrate) steady-state levels. However, A\\u03b242 treatment did not induce significant cellular toxicity, as determined by two independent readouts, nor did it promote APP-CTF generation, as indicated by the analysis of total, soluble APP ectodomain (precursor) levels. In addition, the assessment of the APP-CTF turnover by \\u03b3-secretase and/or general degradation mechanisms defined the inhibition of endogenous \\u03b3-secretases as the most important mechanism contributing to the accumulation of APP-CTF in living neurons treated with human A\\u03b242.

We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020).

It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Luo and Li, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers of amyloid deposition, are crucial for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical relevance is further supported by existing biomarkers that reflect the pathological processes in AD. For instance, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction correlates with cognitive impairment, emphasizing the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the downstream effects of γ-secretase activity on neuronal signaling and health (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). The integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could enhance patient stratification and inform treatment decisions in the evolving landscape of AD therapeutics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

We next investigated the levels of A\\u03b242 in synaptosomes derived from frontal cortices of post-mortem AD and age-matched non-demented (ND) control individuals (Figure 10B). Towards this, we prepared synaptosomes from frozen brain tissues using the Percoll gradient procedure (Dunkley et al., 2008; Fonseca-Ornelas et al., 2021). Intact synaptosomes were spun to obtain a pellet which was resuspended in the minimum amount of PBS, allowing us to estimate the volume containing the resuspended synaptosome sample. This is likely an overestimate of the actual synaptosome volume. Finally, synaptosomes were lysed in RIPA buffer and A\\u03b2 peptide concentrations were measured using ELISA (MSD). We observed that the concentration of A\\u03b242 in the synaptosomes from (end-stage) AD tissues was significantly higher (10.7 nM) than those isolated from non-demented tissues (0.7 nM), ***p<0.0005. These data provide evidence for accumulation at nM concentrations of endogenous A\\u03b242 in synaptosomes in end-stage AD brains. Given that we measured A\\u03b242 concentration in synaptosomes, we speculate that even higher concentrations of this peptide may be present in the endolysosome vesicle system, and therein inhibit the endogenous processing of APP-CTF at the synapse. Of note treatment of PC12 cells with conditioned medium containing even lower amounts of A\\u03b2 (low nanomolar range (0.5\\u20131 nM)) resulted in the accumulation of APP-CTFs. Compelling evidence supports that A\\u03b2 peptides trigger molecular and cellular cascades leading to neurodegeneration (Scheltens et al., 2021; Knopman et al., 2021).

The recognition that A\\u03b2 peptides, despite lower affinities, can compete with APP-CTFs for binding to \\u03b3-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations (Szaruga et al., 2017), led us to propose a mechanism that connects increases in the A\\u03b242 peptide with the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases and dysregulation of signaling cascades relevant to neuronal physiology. In this regard, we note that the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase in the adult mouse brain leads to age-dependent neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004) by poorly understood but APP-independent mechanisms (Acx et al., 2017), whereas pharmacological inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase has been linked to cognitive worsening in AD affected individuals (Doody et al., 2013). Here, we found in vitro that human (not murine) A\\u03b242 can inhibit \\u03b3-secretase processing, resulting in (i) the accumulation of substrates at the membrane, (ii) reductions in the release of soluble intracellular fragments from substrates, and (iii) dysregulation of \\u03b3-secretase dependent signaling.

Interestingly, mutations in PS1 change the localization toward that of PS2-containing complexes (67). After the discovery of \\u03b3-secretase, a huge amount of research was carried out to develop potent and bioavailable \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), but the clinical trials based on these inhibitors all failed (Table\\u00a01). Indeed, none of them led to improvement of AD-linked cognitive decline and even sometimes they worsened them. In most of these trials, A\\u03b2 levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly decreased, thus clearly indicating that a reduction in total A\\u03b2 was not sufficient to restore cognitive function. This was the case for Semagacestat, the first GSI tested in late-stage clinical trials for AD, which was reported to reduce A\\u03b2 levels by more than 60% in the plasma (110), and new A\\u03b2 synthesis was decreased by more than 80% in CSF (111). More alarming, many trials were readily stopped because of increased risk of developing skin cancer and infections, which was supposed to be tightly linked to a defective Notch signaling in the presence of the inhibitors (112). Therefore, several groups started to screen for drugs having a higher affinity for APP than toward Notch, such as Avagacestat, initially reported to be 140-fold more selective for APP than Notch (113), although its Notch sparing ability remains controversial (114, 115). Avagacestat led to a 40% A\\u03b2 reduction in CSF (Table\\u00a01), but demonstrated similar side effects in clinical trials (116). Therefore, due to the huge number of different \\u03b3-secretase substrates, it has appeared difficult to target specifically and exclusively the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated APP cleavage. Furthermore, data from preclinical trials proposed that the lack of efficacy, or even worsening, of cognitive function in these trials was also linked to the progressive accumulation of APP-CTFs in the presence of GSIs (117). To avoid such effects, therapeutic development became focused on \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that were expected to be safer, since they interact with \\u03b3-secretase complex through the allosteric binding site, thereby modifying the enzyme activity but not blocking it (118). The concept of \\u03b3-secretase modulation was discovered with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, which are considered as GSMs, because they induce conformational changes in PS1 and shift the cleavage of C99 toward shorter A\\u03b2 species such as A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 (16, 119). In that way, GSMs do not lead to increased APP-CTFs levels. Indeed, in AD animal models, the chronic treatment with GSMs did not lead to the worsening of cognitive function observed with GSIs (117). Moreover, GSMs are also safer because they reduce the level of A\\u03b242 and increase shorter A\\u03b2 peptides without affecting Notch signaling (120, 121). Nonetheless, the first GSMs tested in clinical trials, Rofecoxib (122), Tarenflurbil (123) or Naproxen (124), did not show efficacy, but the lack of effects seemed to be related to a very poor blood\\u2013brain barrier crossing ability of these drugs (Table\\u00a01).

However, so far the vast majority of, if not all, clinical trials based on these strategies have failed, since they have not been able to restore cognitive function in AD patients, and even in many cases, they have worsened the clinical picture. We here propose that AD could be more complex than a simple A\\u03b2-linked pathology and discuss the possibility that a way to reconcile undoubted genetic evidences linking processing of APP to AD and a consistent failure of A\\u03b2-based clinical trials could be to envision the pathological contribution of the direct precursor of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b2-secretase-derived C-terminal fragment of APP, \\u03b2CTF, also referred to as C99. In this review, we summarize scientific evidences pointing to C99 as an early contributor to AD and postulate that \\u03b3-secretase should be considered as not only an A\\u03b2-generating protease, but also a beneficial C99-inactivating enzyme. In that sense, we discuss the limitations of molecules targeting \\u03b3-secretase and propose alternative strategies seeking to reduce C99 levels by other means and notably by enhancing its lysosomal degradation.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent age-related neurodegenerative disease. After initial clinical characterization, histopathological analysis revealed the presence of two major anatomical lesions signing this pathology: senile plaques that are extracellular protein aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles that are intracellular neuronal lesions (1, 2, 3). Senile plaques are mainly composed of the small 4\\u00a0kDa amyloid beta peptide (A\\u03b2) (4) and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated and cleaved forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (5, 6). The cloning of the A\\u03b2 precursor, the \\u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in the late 80s was a key step in the understanding of the pathology. APP was found to be localized on chromosome 21 (7), thus explaining the development of early-onset dementia and the presence of senile plaques in Down syndrome patients carrying an extra copy of APP due to a duplication of this chromosome (8).

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (7) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (85). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (86-89), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (90).

Since the detection of the endogenous A\\u03b2 products via standard ELISA methods was precluded by the presence of exogenous human A\\u03b242 (treatment), we used an N-terminally tagged version of APPC99 and quantified the amount of total secreted A\\u03b2, which is a proxy for the global \\u03b3secretase activity.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Luo and Li, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers of amyloid deposition, are crucial for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical relevance is further supported by existing biomarkers that reflect the pathological processes in AD. For instance, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction correlates with cognitive impairment, emphasizing the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the downstream effects of γ-secretase activity on neuronal signaling and health (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). The integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could enhance patient stratification and inform treatment decisions in the evolving landscape of AD therapeutics.\n",

This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023).

The inhibitory mechanism is complex, competitive, and reversible, and hence results in pulses of \\u03b3-secretase inhibition. Figure 10\\u2014source data 1.The unedited blots and figures with the uncropped blots with the relevant bands clearly labeled. We next investigated the levels of A\\u03b242 in synaptosomes derived from frontal cortices of post-mortem AD and age-matched non-demented (ND) control individuals (Figure 10B). Towards this, we prepared synaptosomes from frozen brain tissues using the Percoll gradient procedure (Dunkley et al., 2008; Fonseca-Ornelas et al., 2021). Intact synaptosomes were spun to obtain a pellet which was resuspended in the minimum amount of PBS, allowing us to estimate the volume containing the resuspended synaptosome sample. This is likely an overestimate of the actual synaptosome volume. Finally, synaptosomes were lysed in RIPA buffer and A\\u03b2 peptide concentrations were measured using ELISA (MSD). We observed that the concentration of A\\u03b242 in the synaptosomes from (end-stage) AD tissues was significantly higher (10.7 nM) than those isolated from non-demented tissues (0.7 nM), ***p<0.0005. These data provide evidence for accumulation at nM concentrations of endogenous A\\u03b242 in synaptosomes in end-stage AD brains. Given that we measured A\\u03b242 concentration in synaptosomes, we speculate that even higher concentrations of this peptide may be present in the endolysosome vesicle system, and therein inhibit the endogenous processing of APP-CTF at the synapse. Of note treatment of PC12 cells with conditioned medium containing even lower amounts of A\\u03b2 (low nanomolar range (0.5\\u20131 nM)) resulted in the accumulation of APP-CTFs. Compelling evidence supports that A\\u03b2 peptides trigger molecular and cellular cascades leading to neurodegeneration (Scheltens et al., 2021; Knopman et al., 2021). Here, we discovered and extensively characterized a previously unreported role for A\\u03b2: inhibition of the activity of \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 10C and D). The recognition that A\\u03b2 peptides, despite lower affinities, can compete with APP-CTFs for binding to \\u03b3-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations (Szaruga et al., 2017), led us to propose a mechanism that connects increases in the A\\u03b242 peptide with the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases and dysregulation of signaling cascades relevant to neuronal physiology. In this regard, we note that the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase in the adult mouse brain leads to age-dependent neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004) by poorly understood but APP-independent mechanisms (Acx et al., 2017), whereas pharmacological inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase has been linked to cognitive worsening in AD affected individuals (Doody et al., 2013). Here, we found in vitro that human (not murine) A\\u03b242 can inhibit \\u03b3-secretase processing, resulting in (i) the accumulation of substrates at the membrane, (ii) reductions in the release of soluble intracellular fragments from substrates, and (iii) dysregulation of \\u03b3-secretase dependent signaling.

Notably, despite the high homology between human and murine A\\u03b2 sequences, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 failed to inhibit the proteolysis of APPC99, implying that structural determinants in the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 are involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Consistent with this view, N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b211\\u201342 and p3 17\\u201342) demonstrated reduced or no inhibitory properties, compared to human A\\u03b242.

Moreover, our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter A\\u03b21-x species (x=37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human A\\u03b242. The reported lower affinities of shorter A\\u03b2 peptides towards \\u03b3-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (Szaruga et al., 2017). Our analysis on cultured neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human A\\u03b242, but not p3, resulted in the accumulation of \\u03b3-secretase substrates. This phenotype is consistent with an A\\u03b242-induced inhibitory effect on \\u03b3-secretase activity, but could also be a consequence of alterations in cellular mechanisms that define protein (substrate) steady-state levels. However, A\\u03b242 treatment did not induce significant cellular toxicity, as determined by two independent readouts, nor did it promote APP-CTF generation, as indicated by the analysis of total, soluble APP ectodomain (precursor) levels. In addition, the assessment of the APP-CTF turnover by \\u03b3-secretase and/or general degradation mechanisms defined the inhibition of endogenous \\u03b3-secretases as the most important mechanism contributing to the accumulation of APP-CTF in living neurons treated with human A\\u03b242.

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Luo and Li, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers of amyloid deposition, are crucial for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical relevance is further supported by existing biomarkers that reflect the pathological processes in AD. For instance, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction correlates with cognitive impairment, emphasizing the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the downstream effects of γ-secretase activity on neuronal signaling and health (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). The integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could enhance patient stratification and inform treatment decisions in the evolving landscape of AD therapeutics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50). Further studies also revealed a very complex cleavage of APP-CTFs by \\u03b3-secretase, since it takes place within the membrane and successively at several sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6-, \\u03b3- and \\u03b3\\u2032). The first endopeptidase cleavage (\\u025b-cleavage) can occur at two distinct sites leading to the generation of A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249, which is then shortened by sequential carboxypeptidase cleavages (trimming) at \\u03b6, \\u03b3-and \\u03b3\\u2032-sites, occurring at each three or four residues and via two distinct product lines (A\\u03b249 > A\\u03b246 > A\\u03b243 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b237) or (A\\u03b248 > A\\u03b245 > A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b238) and the final occurrence of peptides of varying lengths but two major species of 40 or 42 amino acid residues, respectively (51). Whereas A\\u03b240 is the most abundant peptide, A\\u03b242 is considered as the most pathogenic due to its high aggregation propensity.Figure\\u00a02\\u03b3-secretase.A, displays a schematic representation of presenilins (PS1 or PS2) composed of nine transmembrane domains and harboring the catalytic core of the complex with two aspartyl residues in the transmembrane domains TM-6 and TM-7.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Notably, despite the high homology between human and murine A\\u03b2 sequences, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 failed to inhibit the proteolysis of APPC99, implying that structural determinants in the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 are involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Consistent with this view, N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b211\\u201342 and p3 17\\u201342) demonstrated reduced or no inhibitory properties, compared to human A\\u03b242. The p3 peptides lack the 16 amino acids long, hydrophilic, and disordered N-terminal domain present in A\\u03b2, but do contain the two aggregation-prone regions (16\\u201321 and 29\\u201342) required for the assembly of oligomers (Festa, 2019; Dulin et al., 2008) and fibrils (Higgins et al., 1996; L\\u00f3pez de la Paz and Serrano, 2004; Kuhn et al., 2020). Despite p3 peptides\\u2019 aggregation-prone behavior (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020) and their accumulation in AD brain (Higgins et al., 1996; Saido et al., 1996; Lalowski et al., 1996; Gowing et al., 1994), the neurotoxicity of these peptides is not well defined (Walsh et al., 2002). Moreover, our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter A\\u03b21-x species (x=37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human A\\u03b242. The reported lower affinities of shorter A\\u03b2 peptides towards \\u03b3-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (Szaruga et al., 2017). Our analysis on cultured neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human A\\u03b242, but not p3, resulted in the accumulation of \\u03b3-secretase substrates. This phenotype is consistent with an A\\u03b242-induced inhibitory effect on \\u03b3-secretase activity, but could also be a consequence of alterations in cellular mechanisms that define protein (substrate) steady-state levels. However, A\\u03b242 treatment did not induce significant cellular toxicity, as determined by two independent readouts, nor did it promote APP-CTF generation, as indicated by the analysis of total, soluble APP ectodomain (precursor) levels. In addition, the assessment of the APP-CTF turnover by \\u03b3-secretase and/or general degradation mechanisms defined the inhibition of endogenous \\u03b3-secretases as the most important mechanism contributing to the accumulation of APP-CTF in living neurons treated with human A\\u03b242.

Interestingly, mutations in PS1 change the localization toward that of PS2-containing complexes (67). After the discovery of \\u03b3-secretase, a huge amount of research was carried out to develop potent and bioavailable \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), but the clinical trials based on these inhibitors all failed (Table\\u00a01). Indeed, none of them led to improvement of AD-linked cognitive decline and even sometimes they worsened them. In most of these trials, A\\u03b2 levels in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly decreased, thus clearly indicating that a reduction in total A\\u03b2 was not sufficient to restore cognitive function. This was the case for Semagacestat, the first GSI tested in late-stage clinical trials for AD, which was reported to reduce A\\u03b2 levels by more than 60% in the plasma (110), and new A\\u03b2 synthesis was decreased by more than 80% in CSF (111). More alarming, many trials were readily stopped because of increased risk of developing skin cancer and infections, which was supposed to be tightly linked to a defective Notch signaling in the presence of the inhibitors (112). Therefore, several groups started to screen for drugs having a higher affinity for APP than toward Notch, such as Avagacestat, initially reported to be 140-fold more selective for APP than Notch (113), although its Notch sparing ability remains controversial (114, 115). Avagacestat led to a 40% A\\u03b2 reduction in CSF (Table\\u00a01), but demonstrated similar side effects in clinical trials (116). Therefore, due to the huge number of different \\u03b3-secretase substrates, it has appeared difficult to target specifically and exclusively the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated APP cleavage. Furthermore, data from preclinical trials proposed that the lack of efficacy, or even worsening, of cognitive function in these trials was also linked to the progressive accumulation of APP-CTFs in the presence of GSIs (117). To avoid such effects, therapeutic development became focused on \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that were expected to be safer, since they interact with \\u03b3-secretase complex through the allosteric binding site, thereby modifying the enzyme activity but not blocking it (118). The concept of \\u03b3-secretase modulation was discovered with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, which are considered as GSMs, because they induce conformational changes in PS1 and shift the cleavage of C99 toward shorter A\\u03b2 species such as A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 (16, 119). In that way, GSMs do not lead to increased APP-CTFs levels. Indeed, in AD animal models, the chronic treatment with GSMs did not lead to the worsening of cognitive function observed with GSIs (117). Moreover, GSMs are also safer because they reduce the level of A\\u03b242 and increase shorter A\\u03b2 peptides without affecting Notch signaling (120, 121). Nonetheless, the first GSMs tested in clinical trials, Rofecoxib (122), Tarenflurbil (123) or Naproxen (124), did not show efficacy, but the lack of effects seemed to be related to a very poor blood\\u2013brain barrier crossing ability of these drugs (Table\\u00a01). Thus, taken together, \\u03b3-secretase-based strategies have so far been unsuccessful, even if GSMs seem to be more promising (125). Still, if considering \\u03b3\",\n",

Senile plaques are mainly composed of the small 4\\u00a0kDa amyloid beta peptide (A\\u03b2) (4) and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated and cleaved forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (5, 6). The cloning of the A\\u03b2 precursor, the \\u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in the late 80s was a key step in the understanding of the pathology. APP was found to be localized on chromosome 21 (7), thus explaining the development of early-onset dementia and the presence of senile plaques in Down syndrome patients carrying an extra copy of APP due to a duplication of this chromosome (8). Furthermore, the identification of APP mutations responsible for autosomal dominant form of AD (FAD), including the \\u201cDutch\\u201d (9) \\u201cLondon\\u201d (10) and \\u201cSwedish\\u201d mutations (11), showed that the functional consequences of these mutations were to augment the load of A\\u03b2 and/or to shift A\\u03b2 production to more aggregating A\\u03b2 peptides (12, 13).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Luo and Li, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers of amyloid deposition, are crucial for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical relevance is further supported by existing biomarkers that reflect the pathological processes in AD. For instance, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction correlates with cognitive impairment, emphasizing the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the downstream effects of γ-secretase activity on neuronal signaling and health (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). The integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could enhance patient stratification and inform treatment decisions in the evolving landscape of AD therapeutics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

At the same time, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 poses a risk of developing AD158.

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92.

Crossing APP/PS1 mice with GPR3 KO mice also decreased A\\u03b2 production, and GPR3 was expressed in the brains of SAD patients92.

Recently, IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3, also known as fragilis) was identified as an imidazole GSM, E2012, binding protein158. Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211. Hur et al.158 showed that IFITM3 binds to PS1-NTF in active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production (A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242) (Fig. 6).

This regulation is crucial as only a small percentage of \\u03b3-secretase complexes are catalytically active. Alterations in \\u03b3-secretase activity could relate to neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), given emerging connections between A\\u03b2 peptides, innate immunity, and neuroinflammatory processes.

Interestingly, a recent report suggests that not only are APP and Notch processing modulated by membrane lateral organization but also that \\u03b3-secretase can actively recruit specific membrane components that create a lipid environment favorable for substrate recognition and activity (Barros et al., 2020). The regulation of \\u03b3-secretase has been and continues to be, a major question in the field because of its numerous substrates that regulate many biological processes ranging from neuronal development, angiogenesis to tumorigenesis (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013). While the expression of the essential \\u03b3-secretase components is ubiquitous in all tissues, only a small percentage of \\u03b3-secretase complexes are catalytically active (Lai et al., 2003). The existence of the inactive complex raises three critical questions: (1) Why does the inactive complex exist? (2) Can the inactive complex be activated? and (3) Does the activation play a role in AD and cancer? Furthermore, since the gene expression and the protein level of PS are not correlated with enzymatic activity in cells, it is challenging to assess the active \\u03b3-secretase complex (Lai et al., 2003; Placanica et al., 2009a). Therefore, the development of accurate \\u03b3-secretase activity assays (Shelton et al., 2009a, b), as well as photoaffinity labeling using a transition state inhibitor, are valuable tools to study \\u03b3-secretase (Crump et al., 2013; Nie et al., 2020). The notion that an abundant protease like \\u03b3-secretase must respond to changes in the environment has led to the hypothesis that a fraction of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes exist in a partially dormant state and can be activated and attenuated by binding of \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins (GSMPs; Figure 1). Numerous proteins had been identified to interact with the core complex and impact \\u03b3-secretase activity (Chen et al., 2006; Vetrivel et al., 2007; Gertsik et al., 2014; Villa et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2019; Hur et al., 2020; Jung et al., 2020). In this review article, we will focus on the recent progress GSMPs and their regulation. \\u03b3-Secretase complex activation in response to cellular environmental changes. Schematic representation of inactive/active \\u03b3-secretase equilibrium. \\u03b3-Secretase obligatory subunits are abundantly expressed in all tissues and cells, however, most of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes are not catalytically active (left, the two blades of scissors are not at correct position). To adapt cellular changes, \\u03b3-secretase can be activated by turning the inactive complexes to active ones (right, functional scissors) that selectively promote the cleavage of a specific substrate. The implication is 2-fold: first, inactive \\u03b3-secretase complexes are physiologically important, and second, \\u03b3-secretase can be temporally regulated. Although genetic and animal studies support that A\\u03b2 peptides play a causative role in AD, the physiological role of A\\u03b2 is not clear. Recent studies suggest that A\\u03b2 peptides have antimicrobial and antiviral properties and function as part of the innate immune response of the brain (Vijaya Kumar et al., 2016; Eimer et al., 2018). Also, neuroinflammation has been established as a critical component of AD pathogenesis (Heneka et al., 2015), therefore, a connection between the two elements is under active investigation.

It also improved the memory deficits in AD model mice.317 Unfortunately, all of them have been discontinued in the clinical trials. Immunotherapy has been considered as one of the most promising strategies aimed at the modification of AD development. This approach involves designing synthetic peptides or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to decrease brain A\\u03b2 load and slow the disease progression. The first AD vaccine tested in a clinical study was AN1792, a synthetic full-length A\\u03b242 peptide.318 Although the vaccine showed some therapeutic effects, including slowed cognitive decline, the clinical trials were terminated due to the occurrence of aseptic meningoencephalitis in 6% of the participants.319\\u2013321 A possible explanation for this side effect is the induction of T helper 2 (Th2) cell responses by the excipients applied to produce C-terminus region of A\\u03b2 peptides.321 Accordingly, the subsequent vaccines do not include this region of A\\u03b2 peptides. Vanutide cridificar (ACC-001) is a conjugate of multiple short A\\u03b2 fragments to avoid the safety concerns associated with AN1792.322 Preclinical data showed that vanutide cridificar induced the generation of N-terminal anti-A\\u03b2 antibodies and successfully improved cognitive impairment in AD animal models. However, all clinical trials using vanutide cridificar were also discontinued following a serious adverse event.323 Another example is Lu AF20513, which is a mixed peptide containing three repeats of the first 12 amino acids of A\\u03b2 peptide interspersed with tetanus toxin sequences. The peptide was designed to activate a B cell response to produce polyclonal antibodies against A\\u03b2. While Lu AF20513 was shown to successfully remove brain amyloid deposits in the initial preclinical study, clinical trials were terminated due to a lack of efficacy.324 Currently, four vaccines are under the clinical trials, including ALZ-101 (Phase 1), ACI-24 (Phase 2), ABvac 40 (Phase 2) and UB311 (Phase 3). ALZ-101 is a vaccine specific to soluble A\\u03b2 oligomers rather than A\\u03b2 monomers or fibrils.325 It is undergoing a Phase 1B study. ACI-24 is a liposome vaccine based on the A\\u03b21-15 sequences. It is designed to generate antibodies specifically against the \\u03b2-sheet folding of A\\u03b2. In the preclinical studies, ACI-24 was shown to generate high titers of anti-A\\u03b2 IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies and improve novel object recognition in AD mice.324 Its Phase 2 trials have been started, in which ACI-24 becomes the first anti-A\\u03b2 vaccine to be evaluated for treating AD in Down\\u2019s syndrome patients. Another vaccine called ABvac40 targets the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 peptides and is also currently being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical studies.326 UB-311 consists of the A\\u03b21-14 peptides in combination with a Th-cell epitope, which was designed to specifically stimulate Th2 cells regulatory immune responses over Th1-mediated autoimmune responses. UB-311 was shown to neutralize A\\u03b2 toxicity and enhance plaque clearance in preclinical studies.327 In the Phase 2 studies, UB-311 also showed its safety and generated A\\u03b2 antibodies in 96% of the patients with mild AD\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

In animal studies, GSIs successfully reduced A\\u03b2 production. DAPT decreased A\\u03b2 levels in the plasma, CSF, or brain of AD transgenic mice117,120. Chronic treatment with LY-411,575 in AD transgenic mice reduced A\\u03b2 but also inhibited Notch signaling, leading to side effects121. Semagacestat (LY-450,139) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163) in Tg2576 mice reduced A\\u03b2 production while increasing APP-CTF122. However, those GSIs impaired normal cognition in wild-type mice122. Begacestat (GSI-953) reduced A\\u03b2 levels in Tg2576 mice123. In clinical trials, GSIs such as semagacestat (LY-450,139, Eli Lilly) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163, Bristol-Myers Squibb) reduced A\\u03b2 production in AD patients124,125. However, the multitude of \\u03b3-secretase substrates has made the development of clinically useful inhibitors difficult. Due to the decreased Notch signaling and the accumulation of APP-CTFs122, side effects such as the risk of skin cancer and infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and worsening cognition led to the pause of clinical trials5,124,125. Therefore, these GSIs are nonselective and inhibit both APP and Notch121,124,126. Avagacestat was reported as a \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI and was shown to have a higher selectivity for APP over Notch cleavage127. However, avagacestat was suggested to be nonselective later based on poor Notch-sparing activity122,128 and its binding site as PS1-NTF128. Another \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI, begacestat (GSI-953, Wyeth/Pfizer), was also discontinued in phase I clinical trial, and the reasons are unclear129. Another concern regarding GSI treatment is the A\\u03b2 rebound effect. GSIs at lower doses increased A\\u03b2 levels, and discontinuation of GSI treatment was observed with a rebound of A\\u03b2 levels130,131. These GSIs target PS1-NTF128.

Instead of inhibiting the whole \\u03b3-secretase activity, modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity by \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) has been tested. GSMs are more attractive disease-modifying agents than GSIs because GSMs (1) inhibit selectively aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 production, (2) increase shorter A\\u03b237 or A\\u03b238 species, (3) do not affect the total A\\u03b2 production and the accumulation of APP-CTF, and (4) spare Notch processing132.

IFITM3 protein is upregulated in a subset of late onset AD (LOAD) patients that exhibit higher \\u03b3-secretase activity. The amount of IFITM3 in the \\u03b3-secretase complex has a strong and positive correlation with \\u03b3-secretase activity in LOAD. These findings reveal an unprecedented mechanism in which \\u03b3-secretase is modulated by IFITM3 by neuroinflammation and increases risks for AD.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u03b3-Secretase consists of four obligatory subunits, presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), Aph-1 and, Pen-24. Increasing evidence suggests \\u03b3-secretase activity can be regulated by \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins (GSMPs)5. Identification of GSMPs is enormously challenging due to the nature of their modulatory, rather than essential, role in \\u03b3-secretase activity and the manner of cellular context-dependent interaction, such as Hif1\\u03b1 under hypoxia6. \\u03b3-Secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively reduce the production of A\\u03b242, without affecting other cleavages, have emerged as a promising strategy for AD drug development7\\u201310 and are valuable tools to study \\u03b3-secretase. We have shown that E2012-BPyne, a GSM, interacts with PS1 with a target-based approach11. In the present study, we searched for E2012-BPyne binding proteins in an unbiased manner and identified IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3). IFITM3 is an innate immune response protein known to restrict various viral infections12. We have determined that IFITM3 binds \\u03b3-secretase and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production. This study reveals an unprecedented connection between innate immunity and A\\u03b2 and strongly suggests that neuroinflammation can modulate \\u03b3-secretase production of A\\u03b2. Furthermore, IFITM3 increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production in a subpopulation of LOAD patients and, therefore, could be a potential risk factor for AD. IFITM3 may function as an immune switch to increase \\u03b3-secretase activity for production of A\\u03b2 for its anti-microbial activity13,14, and consequently, contribute to AD pathogenesis. To identify GSM-binding proteins, E2012-BPyne (Fig. 1a) was incubated with cell membranes, photolabeled, clicked with TAMRA-azide and analysed by gel fluorescence (Fig. 1b).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Luo and Li, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers of amyloid deposition, are crucial for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical relevance is further supported by existing biomarkers that reflect the pathological processes in AD. For instance, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction correlates with cognitive impairment, emphasizing the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the downstream effects of γ-secretase activity on neuronal signaling and health (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). The integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could enhance patient stratification and inform treatment decisions in the evolving landscape of AD therapeutics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a), but kinetic modeling combined with informative site-directed mutagenesis will be important to fully unravel the function of these remarkable structures (Bhattarai et al, 2022; Chen et al, 2023; Petit et al, 2022b).

Unfortunately, little was learned from the failed trials\\u00a0(De Strooper, 2014), and \\u03b3-secretases were largely deprioritized as drug targets for the industry in the context of AD. Interestingly, the capacity of GSIs to block Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999) remained all this time of interest to companies in the context of cancer and chronic inflammation (McCaw et al, 2021; Christopoulos et al, 2021). Nirogacestat (Ogsiveo) recently became the first GSI to reach regulatory approval for rare desmoid tumors that are non-cancerous growths of the connective tissue (Gounder et al, 2023) (see Box\\u00a01). Recent success with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) in AD have considerably changed the perspective on the potential of A\\u03b2 lowering as a possible therapy for this devastating disorder (Karran et al, 2011; Karran and De Strooper, 2022). However, various aspects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy may not make them the optimal therapeutic choice for primary prevention clinical studies. A possible approach to primary prevention might be the suppression of A\\u03b2 production so that the key A\\u03b2 plaque-seeding peptides are not produced in sufficient concentrations to initiate plaque formation. While inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase or of BACE1, the other protease that is needed to release A\\u03b2 from APP (Fig.\\u00a01), remain formal possibilities, both approaches suffer from the same dilemma: can a therapeutic window be established sparing the normal functions of both enzymes? To administer agents that already carry known adverse events to normal individuals lacks clinical equipoise. Gamma-secretase allosteric stabilizers (GSAS), in contrast to \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), theoretically allow normal physiological processing of the many substrates of the \\u03b3-secretases, while enhancing the processive cleavage of the A\\u03b2 peptide, favouring the generation of shorter forms as we will discuss below. The GSASs avoid the mechanism-based side effects that precluded the clinical development of GSIs and revert the production of all long A\\u03b2 peptides to shorter forms, in contrast to the earlier \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSM) that were directed to A\\u03b242 lowering (Weggen et al, 2001; Luo and Li, 2022). In the first part of this review, we will discuss our current understanding of \\u03b3-secretases and the effect of clinical mutations on their activity, resolving ongoing controversy in the field. We will stress how novel insights from cryo-EM structures (Yang et al, 2021) and a better understanding of function\\u00a0(Petit et al, 2022a; Szaruga et al, 2017) and cell biology (Sannerud et al, 2016) of the \\u03b3-secretases have allowed insights into the mode of action of GSASs. In the second part of the review, we will use these insights to explain the mode of action of GSASs and to discuss the roadblocks to further clinical development of GSAS-based precision medicine approaches for the prevention of AD. One of the major aims of the therapeutic development of GSIs in AD was to separate Notch from APP processing. The putative Notch sparing inhibitor avagacestat (Coric et al, 2015) made it to a phase-II clinical trial but was halted because of Notch and other side effects.

We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced. We propose the term \\u201c\\u03b3-secretase allosteric stabilizers\\u201d (GSAS) to distinguish these compounds from the rather heterogenous class of GSM.

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4].

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

Modifying any of the heterocycles on E2012 could improve binding affinity and/or selectivity for imidazole-like GSMs. GSMs bind to multiple allosteric sites on \\u03b3-secretase, which in turn may alter conformation of the active site (Fig.\\u00a09B) [85]. While these structural studies will need to be supported by experimental data, they can be applied towards rational design of the next generation GSIs and GSMs for AD therapeutics. While targeting \\u03b3-secretase has proven challenging, it should not diminish its potential as a crucial target for AD pathogenesis. The serious toxicities that halted clinical studies of GSIs demonstrated there were many knowledge gaps about \\u03b3-secretase biology and underestimation of its nuanced proteolysis before the compounds were evaluated in humans [49]. GSMs aim to stimulate \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s carboxypeptidase-like trimming of A\\u03b2 peptides to their shorter, less pathogenic forms. Over the past two decades, industry and academic groups have optimized the potency and CNS penetration of GSMs, several of which have started clinical trials. The success of small molecule GSMs, as with other A\\u03b2-targeted therapies, also depend on being administered in the early stages of AD pathology well before clinical manifestations. Amyloid-based biomarkers and diagnostics will be vital to identifying and monitoring trial subjects. The development of the first GSM-based radiotracer suggests that that \\u03b3-secretase expression could be monitored in AD patients. In the past several years, detailed structures of \\u03b3-secretase have emerged. These structures have already been used in computational docking studies for GSMs [91]. Modeling GSMs with varying chemotypes could be insightful for comparing their mechanisms of recognizing and altering substrate and enzyme transmembrane domains. The latest \\u03b3-secretase structures bound to GSIs and E2012 offer a wealth of information for the design and lead optimization of more potent and substrate-selective small molecules. Drug combinations using drugs which act on distinct targets or show different mechanisms of action have been commonly been used in cancer [92]. A few combination therapies could involve (1) distinct structural classes of GSMs (2) GSMs and inhibitors of tau in neurofibrillary tangles, and (3) GSMs and agents which stimulate A\\u03b2 clearance.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase allosteric stabilizers (GSAS) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Luo and Li, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers of amyloid deposition, are crucial for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical relevance is further supported by existing biomarkers that reflect the pathological processes in AD. For instance, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction correlates with cognitive impairment, emphasizing the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the downstream effects of γ-secretase activity on neuronal signaling and health (Luo and Li, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). The integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could enhance patient stratification and inform treatment decisions in the evolving landscape of AD therapeutics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in CSF and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between these biomarkers and cognitive decline highlights their relevance in clinical settings (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the exploration of plasma biomarkers such as pTau231 may provide further insights into disease progression and treatment response, reinforcing the importance of a multifaceted approach to biomarker development in AD research (Hur, 2022).\n",

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with GPR3 KO mice also decreased A\\u03b2 production, and GPR3 was expressed in the brains of SAD patients92. GPCRs require adaptor proteins such as arrestins to prevent further G protein-mediated signaling206. \\u03b2-Arrestin1 is highly expressed in the brain206, and \\u03b2-arrestin1 KO mice exhibit reduced A\\u03b2 production and spared Notch cleavage207. \\u03b2-arrestin1 interacts only with Aph-1 in \\u03b3-secretase, and overexpression of \\u03b2-arrestin1 enhanced mature \\u03b3-secretase complex formation at 440\\u2009kDa207.

Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) was also reported to regulate the assembly of \\u03b3-secretase complexes and contribute to A\\u03b2 pathogenesis208. SERP1 interacts with the Aph-1a/Nct subcomplex of \\u03b3-secretase and increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 generation but reduces Notch processing208. Recently, IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3, also known as fragilis) was identified as an imidazole GSM, E2012, binding protein158. Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy.

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004).

The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019). (A) The scheme depicts the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) and p3 peptides.

The differences in the amino acid sequence of human (hu) vs murine (mu) A\\u03b2 peptides and the positions of \\u03b2\\u2019- and \\u03b1-cleavages (that precede the generation of A\\u03b211\\u201342 and p3 17\\u201342 peptides, respectively) are indicated.

      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",

      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in CSF and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between these biomarkers and cognitive decline highlights their relevance in clinical settings (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the exploration of plasma biomarkers such as pTau231 may provide further insights into disease progression and treatment response, reinforcing the importance of a multifaceted approach to biomarker development in AD research (Hur, 2022).\n",

The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

The efficiency of \\u03b3-secretase cleavage determines A\\u03b2 length, impacting its neurotoxic properties. Mutations favoring the amyloidogenic pathway, leading to A\\u03b242 production, are associated with increased AD risk.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B).

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

      "    \"summary: The excerpt discusses how elevated levels of amyloid-beta 42 (A\\u03b242) in the endosomal compartment contribute to Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease (AD) by inhibiting \\u03b3-secretase activity, which is critical for cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP) and generating C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). This inhibition leads to the accumulation of APP-CTFs in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) brains, correlating with A\\u03b2 levels at synapses. The study proposes that the \\\"A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase\\\" could reconcile discrepancies in how FAD mutations affect AD development and supports a model where \\\"increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 ... impair\\\" \\u03b3-secretase functions, producing neurotoxic effects.\\n\\n7\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75 or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (7) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (85). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (86-89), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (90). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022). \n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers of amyloid deposition, are crucial for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical relevance is further supported by existing biomarkers that reflect the pathological processes in AD. For instance, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction correlates with cognitive impairment, emphasizing the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the downstream effects of γ-secretase activity on neuronal signaling and health (Zhang et al., 2023). The integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could enhance patient stratification and inform treatment decisions in the evolving landscape of AD therapeutics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, leads to feedback inhibition of γ-secretase activity, which is crucial for the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). This inhibition disrupts normal cellular signaling pathways and contributes to neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed mechanism suggests that elevated levels of Aβ42, especially in the endolysosomal compartment, establish a cyclic inhibitory feedback loop that impairs γ-secretase function and leads to the accumulation of unprocessed APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which are associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments for AD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapies that effectively target the underlying pathophysiology. Current therapies do not halt or reverse the progression of AD, and there is a pressing demand for interventions that can address the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, particularly those related to Aβ metabolism and γ-secretase activity. The identification of γ-secretase as a key player in Aβ generation and its subsequent inhibition by Aβ42 highlights the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating γ-secretase activity to restore its normal function without completely inhibiting its essential roles in other signaling pathways, such as Notch signaling (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in CSF and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between these biomarkers and cognitive decline highlights their relevance in clinical settings (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the exploration of plasma biomarkers such as pTau231 may provide further insights into disease progression and treatment response, reinforcing the importance of a multifaceted approach to biomarker development in AD research (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The clinical relevance of existing biomarkers in AD is underscored by their ability to reflect the underlying disease processes. Biomarkers such as Aβ42 levels in CSF and neuroimaging findings indicating amyloid deposition are critical in diagnosing AD and assessing disease progression. The relationship between Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline further emphasizes the importance of these biomarkers in clinical practice (Hur, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). Additionally, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and the dysregulation of signaling pathways associated with γ-secretase activity highlight the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the broader implications of γ-secretase function in neuronal health and disease progression.\n",

Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (5, 6), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatment with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (7), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (8\\u201312). The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits.

This results in synaptic loss, neuronal loss (notably, the temporoparietal association cortices and medial temporal lobe structures), memory impairment, and enhanced cognitive dysfunction due to progressive neuronal degeneration [17,18]. There are two types of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, classified according to pathological factors and the age of commencement. Early-onset or familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is multifactorial and has a sporadic occurrence. These patients usually present with other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 1and 2), obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome [2]. In the second type\\u2014late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease\\u2014there is an elevation of A\\u03b242 fragment levels, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and excitotoxicity. The pathological process of late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease involves mitochondrial damage of neurons, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the vascular endothelium [19]. Existing biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease include (1) A\\u03b242 (the 42 amino acid form of amyloid \\u03b2) in CSF and (2) total and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF [20]. The utilization of these biomarkers, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, contribute to the early detection of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, with higher diagnostic certainty [21]. The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) system, a biomarker-based biological classification, was published in 2018 by a work group commissioned by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association [22]. There is a reference to A (representing amyloid plaques) and T (tau neurofibrillary tangles); these biomarkers are precise neuropathological indicators of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The \\u03b2-amyloid biomarker is assessed by measuring CSF A\\u03b242 levels using immunoassays for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry or detection of amyloid PET [23]. Phosphorylated tau has been measured extensively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or detected on tau positron emission tomography (PET) [24]. N represents biomarkers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration, which are assessed by measuring total tau in CSF by ELISA or atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; the latter not regarded as disease-specific [25].

Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238.

Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible.

Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C.

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020).

It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript.

Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141].

Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis. A\\u03b2 peptides were purchased from rPeptide, resuspended in DMSO at 500 \\u03bcM, aliquoted into single use 10 \\u03bcl aliquots and stored at \\u201380 \\u00b0C.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022). \n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers of amyloid deposition, are crucial for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in CSF and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between these biomarkers and cognitive decline highlights their relevance in clinical settings (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the exploration of plasma biomarkers such as pTau231 may provide further insights into disease progression and treatment response, reinforcing the importance of a multifaceted approach to biomarker development in AD research (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The clinical relevance of existing biomarkers in AD is underscored by their ability to reflect the underlying disease processes. Biomarkers such as Aβ42 levels in CSF and neuroimaging findings indicating amyloid deposition are critical in diagnosing AD and assessing disease progression. The relationship between Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline further emphasizes the importance of these biomarkers in clinical practice (Hur, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). Additionally, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and the dysregulation of signaling pathways associated with γ-secretase activity highlight the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the broader implications of γ-secretase function in neuronal health and disease progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and total tau levels in CSF, have been widely studied and are clinically relevant in diagnosing AD. Elevated Aβ42 levels in the presence of decreased Aβ40 are indicative of amyloid plaque formation, while increased tau levels correlate with neurodegeneration. These biomarkers can aid in identifying individuals at risk for AD and in stratifying patients for clinical trials targeting γ-secretase and Aβ metabolism (Lewczuk et al., 2017). By integrating biomarker data with clinical assessments, researchers can better understand the relationship between γ-secretase activity, Aβ metabolism, and disease progression in AD.\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.

In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75 or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (7) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (85). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (86-89), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (90). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7).

In summary, trials with \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have clearly shown that CSF biomarkers can be used to verify drug-target engagement and a similar paradigm can be applied to other therapeutic strategies. There is evidence that adequate markers of target engagement might not necessarily capture disease-modifying effects (Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015). The theragnostic value of each biomarker should be individually assessed based on its association to cognitive or functional endpoints. To date, all drugs attempting to modify the course of AD have failed in their primary clinical endpoints. For this reason, it is difficult to address the question of whether CSF biomarkers can predict clinical response. In addition, the total number of patients with CSF measures in clinical trials is still low, further limiting the possibilities to draw firm conclusions. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as surrogate markers of disease modification and as indicators of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The trial with AN1792, the first active A\\u03b2 immunisation study showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo (Gilman et al. 2005). However, treatment with CAD106, another active immunotherapy, did not change the levels of Tau or pTau (Winblad et al. 2012). Most trials with passive immunisation have also included Tau markers in CSF in a subset of subjects. Treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels in both the phase II and phase III trials (Blennow et al. 2012; Salloway et al. 2014). However, this effect was not observed after treatment with solaneuzumab (Doody et al. 2014). These findings could be interpreted as if treatments that act on fibrillar A\\u03b2 have a greater impact on downstream neurodegeneration than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2 (Lleo et al. 2015). Results from ongoing studies with these and other anti-amyloid treatments might shed new biological evidence for the role of CSF markers to detect disease modification. In addition to Tau and pTau, other proteins have been investigated in CSF to monitor the pathophysiological pathways in AD. These novel biomarkers could provide further insights in clinical trials. Tau-independent markers of neuronal damage, such as NF-L, VLP-1, or the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, could give additional information about disease modification effects in trials with anti-Tau therapies, in which levels of total Tau and pTau could be the result of target engagement (Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Synaptic markers (NG, SNAP-25), markers of neuroinflammation/microglial activation (YKL-40 or CCL2) and markers of protein homeostasis and lysosomal dysfunction (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) could be used as indicators of disease progression (Alcolea et al. 2014; Cavedo et al. 2014; Alcolea et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Markers to detect common associated neuropathological comorbidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al.\",\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular -homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) (1). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (5, 6), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatment with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (7), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (8\\u201312). The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits.

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment.

DAPT was considered to result in full \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and hence the values recorded in DAPT treated conditions were used for the background subtraction. We found a ~50% reduction in luminescence signal, directly linked to HiBiT-A\\u03b2 levels, in CM of cells treated with human A\\u03b242 and no effect of p3 peptide treatment, relative to the DMSO control (Figure 3D).

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

It cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the production of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides, notably A\\u03b242, which is linked to neurotoxicity and AD pathogenesis. Mutations favoring amyloidogenic processing have been associated with AD, while those promoting the non-amyloidogenic pathway are protective.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019). (A) The scheme depicts the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) and p3 peptides.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022). \n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The clinical relevance of existing biomarkers in AD is underscored by their ability to reflect the underlying disease processes. Biomarkers such as Aβ42 levels in CSF and neuroimaging findings indicating amyloid deposition are critical in diagnosing AD and assessing disease progression. The relationship between Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline further emphasizes the importance of these biomarkers in clinical practice (Hur, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). Additionally, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and the dysregulation of signaling pathways associated with γ-secretase activity highlight the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the broader implications of γ-secretase function in neuronal health and disease progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers such as CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, and tau levels have been shown to correlate with disease progression and cognitive decline in AD patients. The clinical relevance of these biomarkers lies in their ability to facilitate early diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and evaluate the response to therapeutic interventions. For GSEC-targeted therapies, these biomarkers could be instrumental in stratifying patients based on their baseline Aβ profiles and predicting treatment responses, thereby enhancing the precision of clinical trials and therapeutic applications.\n",

As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75 or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (7) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (85). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (86-89), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (90). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis.\\u201d We have also added figures 10C and 10D, presented here for convenience.

This reviewer thinks that the authors need at least biochemical data, such as levels of Abeta. We have established a novel, HiBiT tag based assay reporting on the global \\u03b3-secretase activity in cells, using as a proxy the total levels of secreted HiBiT-tagged A\\u03b2 peptides.

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.

Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) (1).

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

In summary, trials with \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have clearly shown that CSF biomarkers can be used to verify drug-target engagement and a similar paradigm can be applied to other therapeutic strategies. There is evidence that adequate markers of target engagement might not necessarily capture disease-modifying effects (Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015). The theragnostic value of each biomarker should be individually assessed based on its association to cognitive or functional endpoints. To date, all drugs attempting to modify the course of AD have failed in their primary clinical endpoints. For this reason, it is difficult to address the question of whether CSF biomarkers can predict clinical response. In addition, the total number of patients with CSF measures in clinical trials is still low, further limiting the possibilities to draw firm conclusions. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as surrogate markers of disease modification and as indicators of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The trial with AN1792, the first active A\\u03b2 immunisation study showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo (Gilman et al. 2005). However, treatment with CAD106, another active immunotherapy, did not change the levels of Tau or pTau (Winblad et al. 2012). Most trials with passive immunisation have also included Tau markers in CSF in a subset of subjects. Treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels in both the phase II and phase III trials (Blennow et al. 2012; Salloway et al. 2014). However, this effect was not observed after treatment with solaneuzumab (Doody et al. 2014). These findings could be interpreted as if treatments that act on fibrillar A\\u03b2 have a greater impact on downstream neurodegeneration than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2 (Lleo et al. 2015). Results from ongoing studies with these and other anti-amyloid treatments might shed new biological evidence for the role of CSF markers to detect disease modification. In addition to Tau and pTau, other proteins have been investigated in CSF to monitor the pathophysiological pathways in AD. These novel biomarkers could provide further insights in clinical trials. Tau-independent markers of neuronal damage, such as NF-L, VLP-1, or the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, could give additional information about disease modification effects in trials with anti-Tau therapies, in which levels of total Tau and pTau could be the result of target engagement (Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Synaptic markers (NG, SNAP-25), markers of neuroinflammation/microglial activation (YKL-40 or CCL2) and markers of protein homeostasis and lysosomal dysfunction (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) could be used as indicators of disease progression (Alcolea et al. 2014; Cavedo et al. 2014; Alcolea et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Markers to detect common associated neuropathological comorbidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al.\",\n",

The following R packages were used for the analysis: readxl, ggplot2, plyr, dplyr, DescTools, gridExtra and reshape2 (Wickham, 2016; Wickham, 2007; Wickham, 2011). p<0.05 was considered as a predetermined threshold for statistical significance. One-way or two-way ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunnett\\u2019s, Tukey\\u2019s, or Dunn multiple comparison test or unpaired Student\\u2019s t-test were used, as described in the legends. In this manuscript, the authors tested the hypothesis that A\\u03b242 toxicity arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. The authors provide useful findings, showing convincingly that human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity. The data will be of interest to all scientists working on neurodegenerative diseases. Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its function in cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is highly prone to aggregation and implicated in plaque formation. The accumulation of Aβ42 in the brain has been linked to neurotoxicity and cognitive decline, making γ-secretase a crucial target for therapeutic intervention (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Hur, 2022). \n",
      "\n",
      "There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments that can modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies that can target the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, reflects a growing recognition of the importance of modulating Aβ levels, yet challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zhang et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through the use of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could provide a means to selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complex nature of AD pathology, combination therapies targeting multiple pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. For example, combining γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively regulate γ-secretase activity with other agents that target neuroinflammation or tau pathology could provide a more comprehensive approach to managing AD. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with broad-spectrum γ-secretase inhibitors, which can disrupt critical signaling pathways, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted nature of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Additionally, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The clinical relevance of existing biomarkers in AD is underscored by their ability to reflect the underlying disease processes. Biomarkers such as Aβ42 levels in CSF and neuroimaging findings indicating amyloid deposition are critical in diagnosing AD and assessing disease progression. The relationship between Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline further emphasizes the importance of these biomarkers in clinical practice (Hur, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). Additionally, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and the dysregulation of signaling pathways associated with γ-secretase activity highlight the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the broader implications of γ-secretase function in neuronal health and disease progression.\n",

This inhibition may explain the accumulation of APP-C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) brains, correlating with increased A\\u03b2 levels. The data suggest a \\\"cyclical inhibition\\\" of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242, with a critical role in neurotoxicity and disease progression. Furthermore, it ties A\\u03b242 levels directly to the loss of \\u03b3-secretase function, integrating various pathways contributing to neurodegeneration.\\n\\n8\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

It notes that \\\"the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent\\\" across trials. Additionally, the findings suggest that AD trials have shown potential alterations in tau levels; for example, treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF phosphorylated tau (pTau) levels. These fluctuations in biomarker levels provide insight into disease progression and cognitive decline associated with AD.\\n\\n8\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \"bidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

This results in synaptic loss, neuronal loss (notably, the temporoparietal association cortices and medial temporal lobe structures), memory impairment, and enhanced cognitive dysfunction due to progressive neuronal degeneration [17,18]. There are two types of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, classified according to pathological factors and the age of commencement. Early-onset or familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is multifactorial and has a sporadic occurrence. These patients usually present with other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 1and 2), obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome [2]. In the second type\\u2014late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease\\u2014there is an elevation of A\\u03b242 fragment levels, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and excitotoxicity. The pathological process of late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease involves mitochondrial damage of neurons, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the vascular endothelium [19]. Existing biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease include (1) A\\u03b242 (the 42 amino acid form of amyloid \\u03b2) in CSF and (2) total and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF [20]. The utilization of these biomarkers, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, contribute to the early detection of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, with higher diagnostic certainty [21]. The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) system, a biomarker-based biological classification, was published in 2018 by a work group commissioned by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association [22]. There is a reference to A (representing amyloid plaques) and T (tau neurofibrillary tangles); these biomarkers are precise neuropathological indicators of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The \\u03b2-amyloid biomarker is assessed by measuring CSF A\\u03b242 levels using immunoassays for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry or detection of amyloid PET [23]. Phosphorylated tau has been measured extensively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or detected on tau positron emission tomography (PET) [24]. N represents biomarkers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration, which are assessed by measuring total tau in CSF by ELISA or atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; the latter not regarded as disease-specific [25]. There are respective cut-off points for A, T, and N, which are classified as normal (\\u2212) or abnormal (+), with, subsequently, eight different AT(N) biomarker profiles [26]. Over the last two decades, there has been significant growth in the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review presents current evidence from many clinical neurochemical studies on core and novel CSF biomarkers that assess all aspects of the pathophysiology of the disease.

Publications that were not in English were excluded due to the challenges of evaluating the contents as accessible open resources. The most relevant or primary studies were included in this analysis, and replicated contents were omitted along with studies with a small sample size (Figure 1). Studies with important findings of key CSF biomarkers are included in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Of note, key findings of meta-analysis articles are given in Table 1. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141]. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein is involved with the transportation of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated as a biomarker of brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [142].

This review presents current evidence from many clinical neurochemical studies, with findings that attest to the efficacy of existing core CSF biomarkers such as total tau, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242), which diagnose Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in the early and dementia stages of the disorder. The heterogeneity of the pathophysiology of the late-onset disease warrants the growth of the Alzheimer\\u2019s disease CSF biomarker toolbox; more biomarkers showing other aspects of the disease mechanism are needed. This review focuses on new biomarkers that track Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathology, such as those that assess neuronal injury (VILIP-1 and neurofilament light), neuroinflammation (sTREM2, YKL-40, osteopontin, GFAP, progranulin, and MCP-1), synaptic dysfunction (SNAP-25 and GAP-43), vascular dysregulation (hFABP), as well as CSF \\u03b1-synuclein levels and TDP-43 pathology. Some of these biomarkers are promising candidates as they are specific and predict future rates of cognitive decline.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

For this reason, it is difficult to address the question of whether CSF biomarkers can predict clinical response. In addition, the total number of patients with CSF measures in clinical trials is still low, further limiting the possibilities to draw firm conclusions. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as surrogate markers of disease modification and as indicators of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The trial with AN1792, the first active A\\u03b2 immunisation study showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo (Gilman et al. 2005). However, treatment with CAD106, another active immunotherapy, did not change the levels of Tau or pTau (Winblad et al. 2012). Most trials with passive immunisation have also included Tau markers in CSF in a subset of subjects. Treatment with bapineuzumab was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels in both the phase II and phase III trials (Blennow et al. 2012; Salloway et al. 2014). However, this effect was not observed after treatment with solaneuzumab (Doody et al. 2014). These findings could be interpreted as if treatments that act on fibrillar A\\u03b2 have a greater impact on downstream neurodegeneration than those targeting soluble A\\u03b2 (Lleo et al. 2015). Results from ongoing studies with these and other anti-amyloid treatments might shed new biological evidence for the role of CSF markers to detect disease modification. In addition to Tau and pTau, other proteins have been investigated in CSF to monitor the pathophysiological pathways in AD. These novel biomarkers could provide further insights in clinical trials. Tau-independent markers of neuronal damage, such as NF-L, VLP-1, or the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, could give additional information about disease modification effects in trials with anti-Tau therapies, in which levels of total Tau and pTau could be the result of target engagement (Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Synaptic markers (NG, SNAP-25), markers of neuroinflammation/microglial activation (YKL-40 or CCL2) and markers of protein homeostasis and lysosomal dysfunction (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) could be used as indicators of disease progression (Alcolea et al. 2014; Cavedo et al. 2014; Alcolea et al. 2015; Parnetti, Eusebi, et al. 2016). Markers to detect common associated neuropathological comorbidities such as Lewy body or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies should also be further investigated in clinical trials of AD (Cavedo et al. 2014; Mattsson, Carrillo, et al.\",\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

Biomarkers such as Aβ42 levels in CSF and neuroimaging findings indicating amyloid deposition are critical in diagnosing AD and assessing disease progression. The relationship between Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline further emphasizes the importance of these biomarkers in clinical practice (Hur, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). Additionally, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and the dysregulation of signaling pathways associated with γ-secretase activity highlight the need for therapies that target not only Aβ but also the broader implications of γ-secretase function in neuronal health and disease progression.\n",

The clinical relevance of these biomarkers lies in their ability to facilitate early diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and evaluate the response to therapeutic interventions. For GSEC-targeted therapies, these biomarkers could be instrumental in stratifying patients based on their baseline Aβ profiles and predicting treatment responses, thereby enhancing the precision of clinical trials and therapeutic applications.\n",

Elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers like total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242) are critical indicators of cognitive decline, with the t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identifying 89% of mild cognitive impairment cases in a study.\\n\\n9\": {\n",

Notably, p-tau/A\\u03b242 (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 100%) was a good discriminator of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other dementia syndromes [36] (Table 1). Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141]. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein is involved with the transportation of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated as a biomarker of brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [142].

This results in synaptic loss, neuronal loss (notably, the temporoparietal association cortices and medial temporal lobe structures), memory impairment, and enhanced cognitive dysfunction due to progressive neuronal degeneration [17,18]. There are two types of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, classified according to pathological factors and the age of commencement. Early-onset or familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is multifactorial and has a sporadic occurrence. These patients usually present with other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 1and 2), obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome [2]. In the second type\\u2014late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease\\u2014there is an elevation of A\\u03b242 fragment levels, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and excitotoxicity. The pathological process of late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease involves mitochondrial damage of neurons, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the vascular endothelium [19]. Existing biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease include (1) A\\u03b242 (the 42 amino acid form of amyloid \\u03b2) in CSF and (2) total and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF [20]. The utilization of these biomarkers, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, contribute to the early detection of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, with higher diagnostic certainty [21]. The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) system, a biomarker-based biological classification, was published in 2018 by a work group commissioned by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association [22]. There is a reference to A (representing amyloid plaques) and T (tau neurofibrillary tangles); these biomarkers are precise neuropathological indicators of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The \\u03b2-amyloid biomarker is assessed by measuring CSF A\\u03b242 levels using immunoassays for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry or detection of amyloid PET [23]. Phosphorylated tau has been measured extensively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or detected on tau positron emission tomography (PET) [24]. N represents biomarkers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration, which are assessed by measuring total tau in CSF by ELISA or atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; the latter not regarded as disease-specific [25]. There are respective cut-off points for A, T, and N, which are classified as normal (\\u2212) or abnormal (+), with, subsequently, eight different AT(N) biomarker profiles [26]. Over the last two decades, there has been significant growth in the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.

The cleavage position of the \\u03b3-secretase in the transmembrane domain of APP is imprecise, resulting in the production of A\\u03b2 peptides of variable length [166, 289]. Changes in some of these A\\u03b2 species have been associated with AD, as discussed below, but little is known about the changes over time in relation to clinical presentation. The 42-amino acid form of A\\u03b2, A\\u03b242, is a minor component of A\\u03b2 peptides in the CSF [290] and plasma [277], but in AD brains, A\\u03b242 is the principal A\\u03b2 peptide in plaques [113, 155]. Decreases in CSF A\\u03b242 levels in AD patients were first reported by Motter et al. [256]. Several subsequent studies have consistently shown that CSF levels of A\\u03b242 correlate inversely with plaque load as observed in autopsies and in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) [82, 114, 158, 343, 353]. CSF A\\u03b243 is also reported to decrease in AD, but it has similar diagnostic accuracy to CSF A\\u03b242 [39, 193] so research has focused on the latter. CSF A\\u03b242, together with t-tau and p-tau, are biomarkers accepted as supportive of an AD diagnosis [75, 247] (Table\\u00a02), and evidence suggests they may be prognostic of disease progression in both cognitively normal individuals [84, 209] and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [5, 9, 91, 133]. CSF A\\u03b242 has the potential to discriminate AD from FTLD but shows significant overlap with other non-AD dementias [80]. The development of automated assays to measure CSF A\\u03b242 will reduce variability among samples and laboratories and make it easier to interpret results and implement this biomarker into routine clinical practice [295]. However, several unresolved issues remain when using CSF A\\u03b242 in clinical trials. First, there needs to be a better understanding of how to interpret changes in CSF A\\u03b242 levels in AD in response to DMTs, since this is likely to vary with the mechanism of action of the DMT and with the duration of treatment. It seems logical to measure A\\u03b242 to help determine target engagement of drugs designed to reduce A\\u03b2 pathology [88, 208]; however, some trials have reported changes in CSF A\\u03b242 but no improvement in clinical endpoints [298]. Furthermore, truncated, post-translationally modified fragments of A\\u03b2 (e.g. pyroglutamate A\\u03b242) may be more prone to pathogenic aggregation [25, 117], and consideration needs to be given to what forms of A\\u03b242 are being measured. In addition, CSF A\\u03b242 remains relatively stable over time in patients with AD dementia and may have limited utility for monitoring disease progression in this group [34, 41, 367, 402]. Finally, CSF A\\u03b242 measures are influenced by pre-analytical factors such as the type of collection tube and number of freeze/thaw cycles [198, 284, 368], so it is essential to develop harmonized standard operating procedures for sample collection and handling, as established for biomarker studies in the Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [326, 327].

The combination of these CSF biomarkers has resulted in improved sensitivity and specificity than when used alone and is able to predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Over the past ten years, several novel biomarkers of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathogenesis have been identified that can provide greater accuracy in diagnosis and prognosis in study cohorts and a better understanding of the neuropathologic changes during the development of the condition. The investigation of these novel CSF biomarkers and their association with the classical Alzheimer\\u2019s disease triad could signify further development in their clinical applications. Novel CSF biomarkers are necessary in order to advance the differential diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease with a satisfactory discriminating prospect for this condition compared with other neurodegenerative diseases. Levels of CSF hFABP and YKL-40 are suitable markers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and are able to discriminate it from other neurological conditions. Increased CSF YKL-40 predicts the progression from mild cognitive impairment to clinical Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and has been concomitant with humoral immunity. The association of novel biomarkers such as CSF MCP-1 and neurogranin with core biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau has improved their diagnostic accuracy for discriminating between Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. CSF MCP-1 and neurogranin are elevated in the early and late stages of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and are associated with an enhanced rate of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. They complement CSF A\\u03b242, p-tau, and t-tau protein levels, which make them possibly valuable biomarkers for monitoring the progression of the condition. Notably, they may be valuable additions as auxiliary tests to the current panel of core biomarkers; however, further validation is required in large clinical trials. Although CSF progranulin may be elevated during the progress of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and may add to its risk, further investigations are warranted to examine its potential for assessing disease severity and early detection. Likewise, CSF VILIP-1 is associated with p-tau and t-tau, which supports the principle that it is a biomarker of neuronal injury. Studies have shown that it is increased in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients compared with controls and is useful in discriminating Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other dementias. More longitudinal studies are needed to ascertain its ability to predict future cognitive loss in persons with normal cognitive function who develop the disease. Elevated CSF osteopontin and GAF levels are established in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment who subsequently develop the condition. The former test is a biomarker of the prodromal Alzheimer\\u2019s disease stage, and they are both beneficial for monitoring the disease.

The number of people living with AD is predicted to increase; however, there are no disease-modifying therapies currently available and none have been successful in late-stage clinical trials. Fluid biomarkers measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood hold promise for enabling more effective drug development and establishing a more personalized medicine approach for AD diagnosis and treatment. Biomarkers used in drug development programmes should be qualified for a specific context of use (COU). These COUs include, but are not limited to, subject/patient selection, assessment of disease state and/or prognosis, assessment of mechanism of action, dose optimization, drug response monitoring, efficacy maximization, and toxicity/adverse reactions identification and minimization. The core AD CSF biomarkers A\\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau are recognized by research guidelines for their diagnostic utility and are being considered for qualification for subject selection in clinical trials. However, there is a need to better understand their potential for other COUs, as well as identify additional fluid biomarkers reflecting other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Several novel fluid biomarkers have been proposed, but their role in AD pathology and their use as AD biomarkers have yet to be validated. In this review, we summarize some of the pathological mechanisms implicated in the sporadic AD and highlight the data for several established and novel fluid biomarkers (including BACE1, TREM2, YKL-40, IP-10, neurogranin, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, \\u03b1-synuclein, TDP-43, ferritin, VILIP-1, and NF-L) associated with each mechanism.

Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

Over the last two decades, there has been significant growth in the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review presents current evidence from many clinical neurochemical studies, with findings that attest to the efficacy of existing core CSF biomarkers such as total tau, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242), which diagnose Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in the early and dementia stages of the disorder. The heterogeneity of the pathophysiology of the late-onset disease warrants the growth of the Alzheimer\\u2019s disease CSF biomarker toolbox; more biomarkers showing other aspects of the disease mechanism are needed. This review focuses on new biomarkers that track Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathology, such as those that assess neuronal injury (VILIP-1 and neurofilament light), neuroinflammation (sTREM2, YKL-40, osteopontin, GFAP, progranulin, and MCP-1), synaptic dysfunction (SNAP-25 and GAP-43), vascular dysregulation (hFABP), as well as CSF \\u03b1-synuclein levels and TDP-43 pathology. Some of these biomarkers are promising candidates as they are specific and predict future rates of cognitive decline. Findings from the combinations of subclasses of new Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarkers that improve their diagnostic efficacy in detecting associated pathological changes are also presented.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nDementia defines a collection of symptoms due to acquired loss of cognition in numerous domains in such a manner that affects memory, occupational function, and thinking ability. The impairment in cognition significantly interferes with an individual\\u2019s ability to maintain normal daily activity and live a fully autonomous and purposeful life [1]. Globally, Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia, encompassing 60\\u201380% of cases. It has an estimated prevalence of over 40 million individuals worldwide and is reported to be the sixth leading cause of death [2]. The incidence of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease escalates with age, especially in an aging population, and the average duration of the disease from diagnosis to death is approximately 10 years. In the United States of America, an estimated prevalence of 3% has been reported for persons 65\\u201374 years of age, 17% for 75\\u201384 years of age, and 32% for those individuals 85 years and older [3].

      "        \"original_text\": \"375, miR-100, and miR-103 identified Alzheimer\\u2019s disease cases with an accuracy of 95.5% [437]. In a recent study, McKeever et al. examined miRNA expression profiles in CSF-derived exosomes from young-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (YOAD) and late-onset (LOAD) patients [279]. There were decreased expressions of miR-605-5p, miR-16-5p, and miR-451a and upregulation of miR-125b-5p in YOAD patients compared to controls. In the cohort patients with LOAD, there was increased expression of miR-125b-5p and downregulation of miR-605-5p and miR-451a compared to controls [279]. The authors suggested that these miRNAs signify novel targets for unraveling the mechanism of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and the development of potential biomarkers, particularly exosomal miR-16-5p, which is related to YOAD [279]. Significant research is currently being pursued in the area of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarkers; future directions involve the discovery of biomarkers that can evaluate the entire continuum of disease pathogenesis and enable accurate diagnosis in the early stages of the condition. Laboratory assays for blood-based Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarkers are presently being developed, and they may be of assistance in monitoring asymptomatic persons and diagnosing those who are symptomatic. The challenges of lower concentrations of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarkers in the plasma compared with CSF, a more complex matrix, as well as analytical and biological variabilities need to be addressed. Clinical-grade assays on automatic platforms used in the measurement of plasma biomarkers need to be properly validated. There is recently published literature on the use of immune-magnetic reduction assays and single-molecule array technology for plasma-based Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarker measurement [438]. Furthermore, modern advances in the development of proteomics, metabolomics, mass spectrometry, and the use of exosomes have shown significant possibilities for blood-based biomarkers as screening tools for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Beyond the core CSF biomarkers, there are other analytes associated with amyloidogenesis and/or A\\u03b2 metabolism, neuroinflammation, and pathological oxidative changes that have shown potential and are worth future investigation. A\\u03b2 oligomers in blood and CSF have been determined by the use of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). There are many methodological challenges, and, recently, there have been reports on improved methods for measuring A\\u03b2 oligomers and pathological misfolded tau. The protein misfolding cyclic amplification assay is extremely sensitive in identifying A\\u03b2 oligomers in the CSF of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients [280]. In the last few years, a real-time quaking-induced conversion assay has been employed in the ultrasensitive detection of tau aggregates that provides molecular evidence of tau filament propagation in the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [439]. Although these molecular protocols are ultrasensitive and improve the detection of CSF biomarkers, there is a need for method validation and measurement of both A\\u03b2 oligomers and tau aggregates in clinical studies with large populations of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients. Future longitudinal studies are warranted as they are critical for evaluating the association between the detection of these biomarkers and disease progression.

As one of the biomarkers of neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, its levels in CSF are found to be decreased. Decreased concentrations of CSF A\\u03b242 to approximately 50% have been reported in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease compared to healthy controls [46]. In a meta-analysis that comprised 231 studies, including 13,018 controls and 15,699 patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, lower CSF A\\u03b242 concentrations discriminated between those with the disease and controls (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.55\\u20130.58, p < 0\\u00b70001) [27] (Table 1). Likewise, [47] conducted a cross-sectional retrospective evaluation of 17 meta-analyses studies, where there was a comparison of baseline CSF A\\u03b242 concentrations in controls and Alzheimer\\u2019s patients. They reported a reduction in 14 studies (2 studies were unclear) [48,49]. However, in one of the studies, there was an increase in A\\u03b242 concentrations in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in the early and mid-stages [50]. In terms of the clinical utility of CSF A\\u03b242, a mean specificity of 82% (95% CI:\\u200974\\u201388%) and sensitivity of 80% (95% CI:\\u200973\\u201385%) has been stated [51]. The biomarker CSF A\\u03b242, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, establishes acceptable biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. CSF A\\u03b242 is useful for differentiating between Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases [52,53]. In a prospective cohort study, including 65 patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, 26 patients with vascular dementia, and 50 controls, there were significant differences in A\\u03b242 between the two patient groups [53]. In another study, CSF A\\u03b242 had the potential to differentiate Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia from frontotemporal dementia (sensitivity 85%, specificity 77%) [54]. However, there are studies that have reported that A\\u03b242 was not able to discriminate between Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and vascular dementia as its levels were decreased in both disease states [55,56]. There is evidence that suggests that A\\u03b242 may be predictive of the procession of persons with normal cognition and those with mild cognitive impairment [28,57,58]. Buchhave et al. conducted a clinical study of 137 patients with mild cognitive impairment, followed-up for 4.1\\u201311.8 years. They found that that CSF A\\u03b242 precisely predicts the progression of the disease as its levels were significantly reduced at least 5\\u201310 years before conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [57]. Likewise, in the meta-analyses conducted by Diniz and colleagues, low levels of CSF A\\u03b242 were predictive of individuals with mild cognitive impairment who later develop Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [28] (Table 1).

Likewise, in another study of 137 patients with mild cognitive impairment, followed clinically for 4\\u20136 years, and 39 healthy individuals with normal cognitive function, the combination of A\\u03b242 and t-tau had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 87%. The authors suggested the findings were strongly related to future incipient Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment [127]. Conversely, in a meta-analysis involving 5 prospective studies (140 cases and 290 noncases), the CSF P-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio had sensitivities ranging from 80% to 96% and specificities between 33% and 95%. The authors indicated that the variations in sensitivities and specificities could be due to participation sampling, recruitment sources, and reference criteria for target disorders [128]. Cerebrospinal fluid tau (total and phosphorylated) and amyloid-\\u03b2 have been extensively studied as individual biomarkers, and their combination has improved their diagnostic performance for identifying patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [35,129]. Hulstaert et al. reported that combined assessment with CSF A\\u03b242 and tau significantly improved the discrimination of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients from the controls and other neurologic disorders (sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 86%) [35] (Table 1). Moreover, in a meta-analysis of studies examining the diagnostic accuracy of CSF t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in discriminating between frontotemporal lobar degeneration dementias and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, the p-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio had the best distinguishing value, especially in more cognitive-impaired patients [129]. The pathology involved in the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease comprises increased levels of t-tau and p-tau in the CSF due to their release from injured and dying neurons and the polymerization of soluble A\\u03b2 to form insoluble plaques in the brain [130]. Fagan investigated whether CSF biomarkers in combination were able to detect underlying pathologies such as neurofibrillary tangles or amyloid plaques in individuals with normal cognitive function or mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia. The p-tau-181/A\\u03b242 ratio and A\\u03b242 levels had the best diagnostic performances in detecting persons with underlying amyloid plaque pathology [131]. Moreover, in a study involving the combination of CSF amyloid-\\u03b2 and tau biomarkers in the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) cohort, higher CSF t-tau and p-tau and lower CSF A\\u03b242 were found in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients.

      "\n",
      "The γ-secretase complex is integral to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its role in cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42. This peptide is notably prone to aggregation and is implicated in the formation of amyloid plaques, which correlate with neurotoxicity and cognitive decline (McGrowder et al., 2021; Molinuevo et al., 2018). \n",
      "\n",
      "There exists an unmet medical need for effective treatments that modify the disease course of AD. Current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology, emphasizing the necessity for disease-modifying therapies targeting the amyloid cascade. The approval of Aβ-targeted therapies, such as aducanumab, underscores the importance of modulating Aβ levels, although challenges remain in achieving a balance that does not disrupt essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zhang et al., 2023).\n",

      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising.

It notes a cyclical mechanism where increased A\\u03b242 concentration leads to \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and accumulation of amyloid precursor protein carboxy-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). A\\u03b242 can reach concentrations of ~10 nM in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains, sufficient to inhibit \\u03b3-secretase, specifically in endosomal compartments. The interplay between A\\u03b242 levels and \\u03b3-secretase activity is crucial, as demonstrated by the negative effects observed in the failed clinical trial with semagacestat, a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor. \\n\\n8\": {\n",

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Understanding the changes in the molecular composition of A\\u03b2 profiles that are needed to initiate amyloid deposition is a central question in the context of the amyloid hypothesis of AD pathogenesis. To provide insights into the composition of pathogenic A\\u03b2 cocktails, we have studied knock-in rats expressing eight permutations of the FAD APP Swedish and PSEN1 L435F mutations. The APP mutation\\u2019s primary effect is to increase the levels of the \\u03b3-secretase substrate and A\\u03b2 precursor APP-\\u03b2CTF. This leads to a gene-dosage\\u2013dependent increase in all A\\u03b2 species analyzed (i.e., A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243). In contrast, the PSEN1 L435F decreases the activity and processivity of \\u03b3-secretase. As a result, this mutation causes a gene-dosage\\u2013dependent shift from shorter to longer A\\u03b2 species leading to a decrease in total A\\u03b2 amounts. This shift is dramatically obvious for the A\\u03b2 product line 1, as shown by the large increase in A\\u03b243, generated by the third catalytic step, concurrent with a large decrease in A\\u03b240, which is derived from A\\u03b243 in the fourth catalytic step. Coexistence of the two mutations in the same subject causes both synergistic and opposite effects on A\\u03b2 brain composition. For example, the two pathogenic mutations synergistically increase A\\u03b243 levels in a gene-dosage\\u2013dependent manner. In contrast, the Psen1LF allele significantly reduces, also in a gene-dosage\\u2013dependent manner; the increase in A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b238 caused by the Swedish mutation. These changes can be rationally explained by the expression of \\u03b3-secretase with reduced activity/processivity concurrent with increased availability of APP-\\u03b2CTF. IHC analysis shows that, at 14\\u00a0months of age, 100% (10 out of 10) of Apps/s:Psen1LF/LF rats develop amyloid pathology.

PSEN1/2 catalyze production of A\\u03b2 peptides of different length from APP. A\\u03b2 peptides are the major components of amyloid plaques, a pathological lesion that characterizes AD. Analysis of mechanisms by which PSEN1/2 and APP mutations affect A\\u03b2 peptide compositions lead to the implication of the absolute or relative increase in A\\u03b242 in amyloid-\\u03b2 plaques formation. Here, to elucidate the formation of pathogenic A\\u03b2 cocktails leading to amyloid pathology, we utilized FAD rat knock-in models carrying the Swedish APP (Apps allele) and the PSEN1 L435F (Psen1LF allele) mutations. To accommodate the differences in the pathogenicity of rodent and human A\\u03b2, these rat models are genetically engineered to express human A\\u03b2 species as both the Swedish mutant allele and the WT rat allele (called Apph) have been humanized in the A\\u03b2-coding region. Analysis of the eight possible FAD mutant permutations indicates that the CNS levels of A\\u03b243, rather than absolute or relative increases in A\\u03b242, determine the onset of pathological amyloid deposition in FAD knock-in rats. Notably, A\\u03b243 was found in amyloid plaques in late onset AD and mild cognitive impairment cases, suggesting that the mechanisms initiating amyloid pathology in FAD knock-in rat reflect disease mechanisms driving amyloid pathology in late onset AD. This study helps clarifying the molecular determinants initiating amyloid pathology and supports therapeutic interventions targeting A\\u03b243 in AD.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nMutations in the amyloid-\\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) and Presenilin 1/2 (PSEN1/2) genes cause Familial forms of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (FAD). APP processing can result in the formation of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2). PSEN1/2 are the catalytic components of the \\u03b3-secretase complex, a protease that cleaves A\\u03b2 from APP-\\u03b2CTF, a polypeptide generated by \\u03b2-secretase processing of APP. A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths are generated by two \\u03b3-secretase\\u2013dependent product lines consisting of four sequential COOH\\u2192NH2-terminal trimming steps. In the first catalytic step, APP-\\u03b2CTF is processed by \\u03b3-secretase at two \\u03b5-sites generating two membranes bound A\\u03b2 fragments (A\\u03b249, product line 1 and A\\u03b248, product line 2). A\\u03b249 is converted into A\\u03b246 (second catalytic step), which is converted into A\\u03b243 (third catalytic step). Finally, A\\u03b243 is trimmed into A\\u03b240 (fourth catalytic step). In product line 2, catalytic steps 2 to 4 originate the following peptides from A\\u03b248: \\u2192 A\\u03b245 \\u2192 A\\u03b242 \\u2192 A\\u03b238 (1). The efficiency of these catalytic events depends on the activity and processivity of \\u03b3-secretase, and reduced processivity can lead to increased production of longer A\\u03b2 peptides at the cost of shorter A\\u03b2 species. The widely accepted amyloid cascade hypothesis postulates that accumulation of A\\u03b242, which has higher hydrophobicity and is more prone to aggregation than A\\u03b240, in oligomeric forms and amyloid plaques is the main pathogenic trigger of\",\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Ultimately, this ratio provides an overall measure of \\u03b3-secretase processivity along both product lines. Applying this method to an in\\u00a0vitro analysis of A\\u03b2 profiles of 25 FAD-linked PSEN1 mutants, the authors found a linear correlation between mutation-driven alterations in A\\u03b2 profiles and age at onset of AD in humans (9).

Overall, the data indicate that co-expression of the Psen1LF and the Swedish mutations cause both synergistic and opposite effects on A\\u03b2 brain composition in a gene-dosage\\u2013dependent manner: A\\u03b243 production is synergistically increased by the two FAD mutations, while the Psen1LF mutation obliterates A\\u03b238 production, which is increased by the Swedish mutation.

Recently, A\\u03b243 generation and deposition were found to be increased in the brains of those carrying FAD mutations in PS1 [13, 14]. These studies raise the possibility that A\\u03b243 plays a pivotal role in the development of FAD. \\u03b3-Secretase generates each A\\u03b2 under two pathways. At first, A\\u03b249 and A\\u03b248 are cleaved from APP. A\\u03b249 is successively cleaved, mostly to A\\u03b240, via A\\u03b246 and A\\u03b243, while A\\u03b248 is similarly cleaved to A\\u03b238 via A\\u03b245 and A\\u03b242. Of note, the most abundant species, A\\u03b240, is derived not from A\\u03b242 but from A\\u03b243. Moreover, A\\u03b238 is derived mainly from A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 [18\\u201320]. These sequential A\\u03b2 generation mechanisms have been referred to as stepwise processing [18\\u201320]. We previously reported that (i) the levels of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 are proportional, and the levels of A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b240 are also proportional in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sporadic AD participants, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, and cognitively normal controls (NCs). The levels of A\\u03b2 concentration in the CSF might reflect lipid raft-associated \\u03b3-secretase activity from brain cortices [21, 22]; (ii) there is a correlation between the levels of deposited A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 in the cerebral parenchyma in the NCs, MCI, and sporadic AD brains [23]; and (iii) lipid raft-nonassociated \\u03b3-secretase activity in the AD brains increases the generation of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243 from brain cortices, and these released A\\u03b2s into the extracellular space probably form senile plaques [23]. Thus, not only A\\u03b2 in the CSF but also its deposition in the brain parenchyma depends on \\u03b3-secretase activities. Based on these characteristics of \\u03b3-secretase in sporadic AD, we reassessed the mechanism of A\\u03b2 generation and \\u03b3-secretase activity in PS1 mutants using human CSF and in vitro \\u03b3-secretase assays. CSF samples from FAD participants showed low levels of A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 but not some A\\u03b243. Surprisingly, although lipid raft-associated \\u03b3-secretase activity, which was prepared from mutant PS1 stably expressing cells, showed decreased A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, and some A\\u03b242 generation in the in vitro \\u03b3-secretase assay, the level of A\\u03b243 was the same as the level of WT PS1. This \\u03b3-secretase activity was distinctly different from the alteration of \\u03b3-secretase activity found in those with sporadic AD [21]. Liquid chromatography\\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that this altered A\\u03b243 generation was not only from A\\u03b246 but also from A\\u03b248 in the PS1 mutants, despite different stepwise processing pathways. The extent of switching A\\u03b243 generation might reflect FAD onset. The previously measured CSF samples of participants with sporadic AD, MCI, and cognitively NCs were described previously [21]. Briefly, we included 24 participants with AD (mild-to-moderate AD; 50\\u201386 years old), 19 participants with MCI (57\\u201382 years old), and 21 cognitively NC participants (61\\u201389 years old). The CSF samples from 5 participants with (symptomatic) FAD (mutant PS1; T116N, L173F, G209R, L286V, and L381V) were from Niigata University Hospital, and 1 patient with FAD (mutant PS1; L85P) was from Osaka University Hospital.

In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019). (A) The scheme depicts the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) and p3 peptides.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively.

This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",

      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

Often prionopathy and AD-related pathology appear simultaneously (Tousseyn et al. 2015). Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD), being quickly fatal, is an important diagnostic problem. In addition to frequent prion diseases it includes rapidly progressing tauopathies and \\u03b1-synuclein aggregation disorder, autoimmune infections, toxic-metabolic and neoplastic diseases. In patients with RPD, treatable disorders are frequently mistaken for CJD, and a rapidly progressive form of AD that may mimic CJD shows genetics and neuropathology that differ from classical AD, probably representing a distinct subtype of AD (Geschwind 2016). In conclusion, neuropathology using harmonised definitions and standardised inter-laboratory methods, including quantitative assessment of essential lesions, can achieve a diagnosis or classification of dementia disorders in up to 90\\u201395% of cases. In the majority of cases, except for those with known genetic or metabolic background, however, it may not be able to clarify the causes or aetiology of the particular disorder. According to the Consensus Report of the Working Group on Molecular and Biochemical Markers of Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease, published in 1998, AD biomarkers should be able to detect a fundamental feature of the pathology. The diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers should also be documented in autopsy-confirmed dementia cases as the pathological diagnosis still is considered to be the reference standard. As 4% of the more than 5,000 subjects whose CSF samples have been analysed since 2004 at the BIODEM lab at UAntwerp came to autopsy, it has been possible to set up validation studies in subjects with autopsy-confirmed diagnoses. Diagnostic performance was established for the core AD CSF biomarkers (A\\u03b21\\u201342, Tau and pTau181) in 100 autopsy-confirmed dementia and 100 control subjects (Engelborghs et al. 2008). The existing model based on CSF A\\u03b21\\u201342 and Tau aiming at discriminating AD dementia from control subjects (Hulstaert et al. 1999) were validated. The results obtained were very promising and showed that this model can identify all AD cases in the population (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 90.72%). In an independent autopsy-confirmed cohort of AD patients and controls, the Tau/A\\u03b21\\u201342 ratio resulted in sensitivity and specificity values of respectively 85.7% and 84.6% (Shaw et al. 2009). However, as discriminating AD from controls assumes a rather artificial clinical situation, new models were built (Engelborghs et al. 2008; Toledo et al. 2012; Toledo, Cairns, et al. 2013). It was shown that autopsy-confirmed dementia patients could be discriminated from controls with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 89%; but, more importantly, Tau and A\\u03b21\\u201342 optimally discriminated AD from pooled non-AD dementias and controls (sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 89%), and AD was optimally discriminated from non-AD using pTau181 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 93%) (Engelborghs et al. 2008).

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

This review presents current evidence from many clinical neurochemical studies, with findings that attest to the efficacy of existing core CSF biomarkers such as total tau, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242), which diagnose Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in the early and dementia stages of the disorder. The heterogeneity of the pathophysiology of the late-onset disease warrants the growth of the Alzheimer\\u2019s disease CSF biomarker toolbox; more biomarkers showing other aspects of the disease mechanism are needed. This review focuses on new biomarkers that track Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathology, such as those that assess neuronal injury (VILIP-1 and neurofilament light), neuroinflammation (sTREM2, YKL-40, osteopontin, GFAP, progranulin, and MCP-1), synaptic dysfunction (SNAP-25 and GAP-43), vascular dysregulation (hFABP), as well as CSF \\u03b1-synuclein levels and TDP-43 pathology.

Studies with important findings of key CSF biomarkers are included in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Of note, key findings of meta-analysis articles are given in Table 1. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141]. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein is involved with the transportation of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated as a biomarker of brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [142].

However, there is a need to better understand their potential for other COUs, as well as identify additional fluid biomarkers reflecting other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Several novel fluid biomarkers have been proposed, but their role in AD pathology and their use as AD biomarkers have yet to be validated. In this review, we summarize some of the pathological mechanisms implicated in the sporadic AD and highlight the data for several established and novel fluid biomarkers (including BACE1, TREM2, YKL-40, IP-10, neurogranin, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, \\u03b1-synuclein, TDP-43, ferritin, VILIP-1, and NF-L) associated with each mechanism.

AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive decline and behavioural disturbances and pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formed by tau fibrils, together with degeneration of neurons and their synapses, glial activation, and neuroinflammation [37, 149, 314]. The incidence of AD increases with age, and the prevalence is growing as a result of the ageing of the population [6]. To date, no disease-modifying therapy (DMT) has been successful [18]. This lack of success may be partly explained by AD having a complex aetiology and considerable heterogeneity in its pathophysiology, and by\",\n",

Depending of a definition, bio-markers can be linked to the disease process and/or a stage of severity; correspondingly, these criteria allow us to identify AD at a prodromal stage and even at a pre-clinical stage of the disease. Both sets of criteria recognise pre-clinical states of AD, which are characterised by the presence of a positive pathophysiological biomarker in cognitively normal subjects. An estimated 47 million people worldwide were living with dementia in 2015. This number is expected to double every 20 years to 132 million by 2050 (Prince et al. 2015). Due to population growth and demographic aging, the increase is predicted to be highest in low- and middle-income countries (Prince et al. 2015). The most common subtypes are AD, vascular dementia (VaD), DLB, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and PD. Estimates of the proportion of dementia cases attributable to these subtypes vary considerably among studies. There is agreement that AD is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 50\\u201370% of cases. After AD, VaD is the most common cause of dementia, causing around 15% of cases (O\\u2019Brien and Thomas 2015). About 8% of people living with dementia have clinically diagnosed DLB-type, increasing to 10\\u201315% when additional testing was applied (Stevens et al. 2002; Rahkonen et al. 2003). In a meta-analysis of population-based studies, FTD accounted for 2.7% of all dementia cases older than 65 years (Hogan et al. 2016). FTD appeared more common among young-onset dementia patients with prevalence estimates varying from 3 to 26% (Vieira et al. 2013). Although PD is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder (Dorsey et al. 2007), PD-related dementia (PDD) occurs in ~80% of PD patients over the course of their illness (Stevens et al. 2002; Irwin et al. 2017). The characteristic pathological substrates of AD, A\\u03b2 containing plaques and Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles, can be also found in the brains of persons without dementia. In a meta-analysis of non-demented subjects, the prevalence of amyloid pathology as estimated by biomarkers in CSF or by PET imaging was 23% in cognitively normal individuals, 25% in subjects with subjective cognitive impairment and 49% among patients with MCI (Jansen et al. 2015; Hoglund et al. 2017). In cognitively normal subjects, amyloid positivity preceded the onset of the symptoms by 20\\u201330 years (Jansen et al. 2015). In a recent meta-analysis, the prevalence of amyloid pathology in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD-type dementia was found to be 88% at the age of 70. The prevalence decreased with age, from 93% at the age of 50 to 79% at the age of 90. The prevalence was higher in carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \\u03b54 allele, the major genetic risk factor for AD (97% at the age \",\n",

Each biomarker category is rated as normal (relative to the A) or abnormal (+). Individual scores might appear as A+ T\\u2212N+, or A+ T\\u2212N\\u2212, etc. Individuals with an A\\u2212T +N\\u2212, A\\u2212T\\u2212N + or A\\u2212T+N+ fall under the original definition of SNAP (Jack et al. 2012). The ATN classification construct will enable researchers to examine multi-modality biomarker associations where the effects of tauopathy and neurodegeneration/neuronal injury are segregated in individuals who meet criteria for SNAP (Figure 7). From a regulatory perspective, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepts both the IWG and the NIA-AA sets of criteria for diagnosis of AD, for research purposes, and for trial enrichment. The current position of EMA on the diagnostic guidelines is summarised in a draft guidance recently published (EMA 2016). This guideline follows the view that considers AD a pathophysiological continuum with a long-term pre-symptomatic stage preceding many years the clinical manifestation. The aim of the above-cited EMA/CHMP draft guideline was to evaluate, among others, the impact of new diagnostic criteria for AD, taking into consideration also the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic disease stages on clinical trial design; and the use of biomarkers in the different phases of drug development. However, adequate standardisation and validation of biomarkers for regulatory purposes is still lacking (Noel-Storr et al. 2013; Dubois et al. 2014). This also reflects the continuous advances in the diagnostic area of research. In this frame, a step forward is represented by the recent approval in the EU of the radio-pharmaceuticals 18F-florbetapir, 18F-florbetaben and 18F-flutemetamol for PET imaging of A\\u03b2 plaques in the brain. These diagnostic ligands are used in patients evaluated for AD, following an accurate clinical assessment versus other forms of cognitive impairment; their usefulness is being investigated in large observational cohorts. Besides PET, also CSF biomarkers are currently considered, although it is recommended to measure multiple parameters such as A\\u03b21\\u201342, total Tau or its hyperphosphorylated form (Hampel et al. 2014; Medina and Avila 2014). While the core clinical criteria still remain fundamental, biomarkers may increase the specificity of diagnosis (Hampel et al. 2014). Unquestionably, standardisation and harmonisation in their use for early diagnosis of AD along the development of clinical trials needs continuous adjustment. In this context, validation of reliable and sensitive instruments to measure cognitive, functional, behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms especially in early disease stages are strongly encouraged by EMA and other regulatory bodies. The growing use of CSF biomarkers in clinical practice and research studies has had an impact on clinical trials that have incorporated them, assisting in participant selection and monitoring of target engagement. Furthermore, they have the potential to demonstrate evidence of disease modification. It is anticipated that the standardisation of pre-analytical and analytical conditions, together with the implementation of fully automated assays of\",\n",

This results in synaptic loss, neuronal loss (notably, the temporoparietal association cortices and medial temporal lobe structures), memory impairment, and enhanced cognitive dysfunction due to progressive neuronal degeneration [17,18]. There are two types of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, classified according to pathological factors and the age of commencement. Early-onset or familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is multifactorial and has a sporadic occurrence. These patients usually present with other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 1and 2), obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome [2]. In the second type\\u2014late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease\\u2014there is an elevation of A\\u03b242 fragment levels, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and excitotoxicity. The pathological process of late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease involves mitochondrial damage of neurons, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the vascular endothelium [19]. Existing biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease include (1) A\\u03b242 (the 42 amino acid form of amyloid \\u03b2) in CSF and (2) total and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF [20]. The utilization of these biomarkers, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, contribute to the early detection of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, with higher diagnostic certainty [21]. The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) system, a biomarker-based biological classification, was published in 2018 by a work group commissioned by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association [22]. There is a reference to A (representing amyloid plaques) and T (tau neurofibrillary tangles); these biomarkers are precise neuropathological indicators of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The \\u03b2-amyloid biomarker is assessed by measuring CSF A\\u03b242 levels using immunoassays for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry or detection of amyloid PET [23]. Phosphorylated tau has been measured extensively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or detected on tau positron emission tomography (PET) [24]. N represents biomarkers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration, which are assessed by measuring total tau in CSF by ELISA or atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; the latter not regarded as disease-specific [25]. There are respective cut-off points for A, T, and N, which are classified as normal (\\u2212) or abnormal (+), with, subsequently, eight different AT(N) biomarker profiles [26]. Over the last two decades, there has been significant growth in the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review presents current evidence from many clinical neurochemical studies on core and novel CSF biomarkers that assess all aspects of the pathophysiology of the disease.

In addition, a meta-analysis comprising of 25 Alzheimer\\u2019s disease cohorts and 24 controls demonstrated that A\\u03b240 had a marginal size effect and, therefore, only a minor association [27]. Research has investigated the use of A\\u03b240 in assessing neuropathological changes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients [71,72]. Baiardi et al. found no significant variations in the concentrations of CSF A\\u03b240 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients and no association with amyloid deposits in the brain. However, the CSF A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio was a better predictor of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathology than CSF A\\u03b240 in rapidly progressive dementias [72]. There is also a report of a relationship between CSF A\\u03b240 levels and 18F-flutemetamol PET (which measures the concentrations of brain amyloid \\u03b2-protein fibrils). The correlation was more significant in apolipoprotein-E (APOE) \\u03b54 allele-negative individuals compared with APOE \\u03b54-positive subjects [73]. Furthermore, CSF A\\u03b240, along with A\\u03b242 and soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPP\\u03b2; a direct product of BACE1 enzymatic activity), may be valuable in evaluating drugs such as verubecestat, a BACE1 (aspartyl protease \\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) inhibitor that discriminatingly decreases A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients [74]. There are challenges in making a differential diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease using core CSF biomarkers as there are similarities in the patterns and symptoms of the disease with subcortical vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies [75]. In a study of 157 subjects comprising 55 sporadic Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients, 23 non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients, 45 with other neurological diseases, and 34 normal controls, Shoji and colleagues found that while A\\u03b240 levels were comparable between the groups, a decrease in A\\u03b242 levels caused a substantial elevation in the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b2 42 ratio. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio were 82% and 51%, respectively, and the authors suggested that it may be a useful biological marker of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and in the monitoring of treatment [76]. In another study that compared the accuracy of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in discriminating patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia, non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia, and normal subjects, the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio categorized more patients correctly than the use of the A\\u03b242 concentration alone. The improved diagnostic accuracy of the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio (compared with A\\u03b242 concentration only), although not significant, was demonstrated to be 90% vs. 85% when relating Alzheimer\\u2019s disease to non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and 90.8% vs. 87% when relating Alzheimer\\u2019s disease to non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease plus controls [77]. Likewise, in a later study, both A\\u03b238/A\\u03b2 42 and A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratios were significantly different in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients; the latter (although not significant) differentiated persons in this group of patients from those with frontotemporal dementia.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Tambini et al., 2023). \n",

This results in synaptic loss, neuronal loss (notably, the temporoparietal association cortices and medial temporal lobe structures), memory impairment, and enhanced cognitive dysfunction due to progressive neuronal degeneration [17,18]. There are two types of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, classified according to pathological factors and the age of commencement. Early-onset or familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is multifactorial and has a sporadic occurrence. These patients usually present with other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 1and 2), obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome [2]. In the second type\\u2014late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease\\u2014there is an elevation of A\\u03b242 fragment levels, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and excitotoxicity. The pathological process of late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease involves mitochondrial damage of neurons, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the vascular endothelium [19]. Existing biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease include (1) A\\u03b242 (the 42 amino acid form of amyloid \\u03b2) in CSF and (2) total and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF [20]. The utilization of these biomarkers, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, contribute to the early detection of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, with higher diagnostic certainty [21]. The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) system, a biomarker-based biological classification, was published in 2018 by a work group commissioned by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association [22]. There is a reference to A (representing amyloid plaques) and T (tau neurofibrillary tangles); these biomarkers are precise neuropathological indicators of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The \\u03b2-amyloid biomarker is assessed by measuring CSF A\\u03b242 levels using immunoassays for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry or detection of amyloid PET [23]. Phosphorylated tau has been measured extensively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or detected on tau positron emission tomography (PET) [24]. N represents biomarkers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration, which are assessed by measuring total tau in CSF by ELISA or atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; the latter not regarded as disease-specific [25]. There are respective cut-off points for A, T, and N, which are classified as normal (\\u2212) or abnormal (+), with, subsequently, eight different AT(N) biomarker profiles [26]. Over the last two decades, there has been significant growth in the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review presents current evidence from many clinical neurochemical studies on core and novel CSF biomarkers that assess all aspects of the pathophysiology of the disease.

Each biomarker category is rated as normal (relative to the A) or abnormal (+). Individual scores might appear as A+ T\\u2212N+, or A+ T\\u2212N\\u2212, etc. Individuals with an A\\u2212T +N\\u2212, A\\u2212T\\u2212N + or A\\u2212T+N+ fall under the original definition of SNAP (Jack et al. 2012). The ATN classification construct will enable researchers to examine multi-modality biomarker associations where the effects of tauopathy and neurodegeneration/neuronal injury are segregated in individuals who meet criteria for SNAP (Figure 7). From a regulatory perspective, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepts both the IWG and the NIA-AA sets of criteria for diagnosis of AD, for research purposes, and for trial enrichment. The current position of EMA on the diagnostic guidelines is summarised in a draft guidance recently published (EMA 2016). This guideline follows the view that considers AD a pathophysiological continuum with a long-term pre-symptomatic stage preceding many years the clinical manifestation. The aim of the above-cited EMA/CHMP draft guideline was to evaluate, among others, the impact of new diagnostic criteria for AD, taking into consideration also the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic disease stages on clinical trial design; and the use of biomarkers in the different phases of drug development. However, adequate standardisation and validation of biomarkers for regulatory purposes is still lacking (Noel-Storr et al. 2013; Dubois et al. 2014). This also reflects the continuous advances in the diagnostic area of research. In this frame, a step forward is represented by the recent approval in the EU of the radio-pharmaceuticals 18F-florbetapir, 18F-florbetaben and 18F-flutemetamol for PET imaging of A\\u03b2 plaques in the brain. These diagnostic ligands are used in patients evaluated for AD, following an accurate clinical assessment versus other forms of cognitive impairment; their usefulness is being investigated in large observational cohorts. Besides PET, also CSF biomarkers are currently considered, although it is recommended to measure multiple parameters such as A\\u03b21\\u201342, total Tau or its hyperphosphorylated form (Hampel et al. 2014; Medina and Avila 2014). While the core clinical criteria still remain fundamental, biomarkers may increase the specificity of diagnosis (Hampel et al. 2014). Unquestionably, standardisation and harmonisation in their use for early diagnosis of AD along the development of clinical trials needs continuous adjustment. In this context, validation of reliable and sensitive instruments to measure cognitive, functional, behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms especially in early disease stages are strongly encouraged by EMA and other regulatory bodies. The growing use of CSF biomarkers in clinical practice and research studies has had an impact on clinical trials that have incorporated them, assisting in participant selection and monitoring of target engagement. Furthermore, they have the potential to demonstrate evidence of disease modification.

Notably, p-tau/A\\u03b242 (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 100%) was a good discriminator of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other dementia syndromes [36] (Table 1). Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141]. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein is involved with the transportation of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated as a biomarker of brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [142].

Studies with important findings of key CSF biomarkers are included in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Of note, key findings of meta-analysis articles are given in Table 1. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

Depending of a definition, bio-markers can be linked to the disease process and/or a stage of severity; correspondingly, these criteria allow us to identify AD at a prodromal stage and even at a pre-clinical stage of the disease. Both sets of criteria recognise pre-clinical states of AD, which are characterised by the presence of a positive pathophysiological biomarker in cognitively normal subjects. An estimated 47 million people worldwide were living with dementia in 2015. This number is expected to double every 20 years to 132 million by 2050 (Prince et al. 2015). Due to population growth and demographic aging, the increase is predicted to be highest in low- and middle-income countries (Prince et al. 2015). The most common subtypes are AD, vascular dementia (VaD), DLB, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and PD. Estimates of the proportion of dementia cases attributable to these subtypes vary considerably among studies. There is agreement that AD is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 50\\u201370% of cases. After AD, VaD is the most common cause of dementia, causing around 15% of cases (O\\u2019Brien and Thomas 2015). About 8% of people living with dementia have clinically diagnosed DLB-type, increasing to 10\\u201315% when additional testing was applied (Stevens et al. 2002; Rahkonen et al. 2003). In a meta-analysis of population-based studies, FTD accounted for 2.7% of all dementia cases older than 65 years (Hogan et al. 2016). FTD appeared more common among young-onset dementia patients with prevalence estimates varying from 3 to 26% (Vieira et al. 2013). Although PD is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder (Dorsey et al. 2007), PD-related dementia (PDD) occurs in ~80% of PD patients over the course of their illness (Stevens et al. 2002; Irwin et al. 2017). The characteristic pathological substrates of AD, A\\u03b2 containing plaques and Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles, can be also found in the brains of persons without dementia. In a meta-analysis of non-demented subjects, the prevalence of amyloid pathology as estimated by biomarkers in CSF or by PET imaging was 23% in cognitively normal individuals, 25% in subjects with subjective cognitive impairment and 49% among patients with MCI (Jansen et al. 2015; Hoglund et al. 2017). In cognitively normal subjects, amyloid positivity preceded the onset of the symptoms by 20\\u201330 years (Jansen et al. 2015). In a recent meta-analysis, the prevalence of amyloid pathology in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD-type dementia was found to be 88% at the age of 70. The prevalence decreased with age, from 93% at the age of 50 to 79% at the age of 90. The prevalence was higher in carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \\u03b54 allele, the major genetic risk factor for AD (97% at the age \",\n",

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

The number of people living with AD is predicted to increase; however, there are no disease-modifying therapies currently available and none have been successful in late-stage clinical trials. Fluid biomarkers measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood hold promise for enabling more effective drug development and establishing a more personalized medicine approach for AD diagnosis and treatment. Biomarkers used in drug development programmes should be qualified for a specific context of use (COU). These COUs include, but are not limited to, subject/patient selection, assessment of disease state and/or prognosis, assessment of mechanism of action, dose optimization, drug response monitoring, efficacy maximization, and toxicity/adverse reactions identification and minimization. The core AD CSF biomarkers A\\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau are recognized by research guidelines for their diagnostic utility and are being considered for qualification for subject selection in clinical trials. However, there is a need to better understand their potential for other COUs, as well as identify additional fluid biomarkers reflecting other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Several novel fluid biomarkers have been proposed, but their role in AD pathology and their use as AD biomarkers have yet to be validated. In this review, we summarize some of the pathological mechanisms implicated in the sporadic AD and highlight the data for several established and novel fluid biomarkers (including BACE1, TREM2, YKL-40, IP-10, neurogranin, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, \\u03b1-synuclein, TDP-43, ferritin, VILIP-1, and NF-L) associated with each mechanism. We discuss the potential COUs for each biomarker.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nWorldwide, approximately 50 million people are living with dementia, with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) comprising 60\\u201370% of cases [391]. AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive decline and behavioural disturbances and pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formed by tau fibrils, together with degeneration of neurons and their synapses, glial activation, and neuroinflammation [37, 149, 314]. The incidence of AD increases with age, and the prevalence is growing as a result of the ageing of the population [6]. To date, no disease-modifying therapy (DMT) has been successful [18].

In addition, a meta-analysis comprising of 25 Alzheimer\\u2019s disease cohorts and 24 controls demonstrated that A\\u03b240 had a marginal size effect and, therefore, only a minor association [27]. Research has investigated the use of A\\u03b240 in assessing neuropathological changes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients [71,72]. Baiardi et al. found no significant variations in the concentrations of CSF A\\u03b240 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients and no association with amyloid deposits in the brain. However, the CSF A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio was a better predictor of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathology than CSF A\\u03b240 in rapidly progressive dementias [72]. There is also a report of a relationship between CSF A\\u03b240 levels and 18F-flutemetamol PET (which measures the concentrations of brain amyloid \\u03b2-protein fibrils). The correlation was more significant in apolipoprotein-E (APOE) \\u03b54 allele-negative individuals compared with APOE \\u03b54-positive subjects [73]. Furthermore, CSF A\\u03b240, along with A\\u03b242 and soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPP\\u03b2; a direct product of BACE1 enzymatic activity), may be valuable in evaluating drugs such as verubecestat, a BACE1 (aspartyl protease \\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) inhibitor that discriminatingly decreases A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients [74]. There are challenges in making a differential diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease using core CSF biomarkers as there are similarities in the patterns and symptoms of the disease with subcortical vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies [75]. In a study of 157 subjects comprising 55 sporadic Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients, 23 non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients, 45 with other neurological diseases, and 34 normal controls, Shoji and colleagues found that while A\\u03b240 levels were comparable between the groups, a decrease in A\\u03b242 levels caused a substantial elevation in the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b2 42 ratio. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio were 82% and 51%, respectively, and the authors suggested that it may be a useful biological marker of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and in the monitoring of treatment [76]. In another study that compared the accuracy of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in discriminating patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia, non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia, and normal subjects, the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio categorized more patients correctly than the use of the A\\u03b242 concentration alone. The improved diagnostic accuracy of the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio (compared with A\\u03b242 concentration only), although not significant, was demonstrated to be 90% vs. 85% when relating Alzheimer\\u2019s disease to non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and 90.8% vs. 87% when relating Alzheimer\\u2019s disease to non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease plus controls [77]. Likewise, in a later study, both A\\u03b238/A\\u03b2 42 and A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratios were significantly different in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients; the latter (although not significant) differentiated persons in this group of patients from those with frontotemporal dementia.

Likewise, in another study of 137 patients with mild cognitive impairment, followed clinically for 4\\u20136 years, and 39 healthy individuals with normal cognitive function, the combination of A\\u03b242 and t-tau had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 87%. The authors suggested the findings were strongly related to future incipient Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment [127]. Conversely, in a meta-analysis involving 5 prospective studies (140 cases and 290 noncases), the CSF P-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio had sensitivities ranging from 80% to 96% and specificities between 33% and 95%. The authors indicated that the variations in sensitivities and specificities could be due to participation sampling, recruitment sources, and reference criteria for target disorders [128]. Cerebrospinal fluid tau (total and phosphorylated) and amyloid-\\u03b2 have been extensively studied as individual biomarkers, and their combination has improved their diagnostic performance for identifying patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [35,129]. Hulstaert et al. reported that combined assessment with CSF A\\u03b242 and tau significantly improved the discrimination of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients from the controls and other neurologic disorders (sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 86%) [35] (Table 1). Moreover, in a meta-analysis of studies examining the diagnostic accuracy of CSF t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in discriminating between frontotemporal lobar degeneration dementias and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, the p-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio had the best distinguishing value, especially in more cognitive-impaired patients [129]. The pathology involved in the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease comprises increased levels of t-tau and p-tau in the CSF due to their release from injured and dying neurons and the polymerization of soluble A\\u03b2 to form insoluble plaques in the brain [130]. Fagan investigated whether CSF biomarkers in combination were able to detect underlying pathologies such as neurofibrillary tangles or amyloid plaques in individuals with normal cognitive function or mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia. The p-tau-181/A\\u03b242 ratio and A\\u03b242 levels had the best diagnostic performances in detecting persons with underlying amyloid plaque pathology [131]. Moreover, in a study involving the combination of CSF amyloid-\\u03b2 and tau biomarkers in the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) cohort, higher CSF t-tau and p-tau and lower CSF A\\u03b242 were found in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients.

There are other studies that have utilized various CSF biomarkers to differentiate between Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia [79,80]. In a study conducted by Spies et al., the CSF A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio increases the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other types of dementia syndromes such as frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. The A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients was significantly lower than in the other groups [29] (Table 1). In another study where the CSF levels of A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 were measured using an amplified luminescent proximity homogenous immunoassay, the CSF A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio improved the discrimination of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from Parkinson\\u2019s disease with dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, compared with either A\\u03b240 or A\\u03b242 individually [81]. The A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio improved the diagnostic presentation of A\\u03b242 in differentiating Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and vascular dementia [30] (Table 1). Similarly, CSF A\\u03b242/A\\u03b238 and A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios displayed better diagnostic accuracy than CSF A\\u03b242 in identifying brain amyloid deposition in prodromal Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. These ratios also performed better at distinguishing Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other types of dementia such as Parkinson\\u2019s disease dementia, subcortical vascular dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies [82]. Moreover, the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio is stable between the prodromal and demented stages in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies in contrast to what was observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The authors have suggested that the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio is extremely useful for distinguishing Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients from those with dementia with Lewy bodies, mainly at the prodromal stage when clinical diagnosis is challenging [83]. The production of the various monomeric forms of amyloid-\\u03b2, comprising of A\\u03b242 and the initiation of the amyloid cascade, is due to the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) [84]. BACE1 plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and its rates of activity and concentrations have been found to be elevated in body fluids (such as plasma and CSF) and in the brains of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients [85,86,87]. Fukumota et al. reported significantly increased BACE activity and concentration in the temporal neocortex (63% and 15%, respectively) and frontal neocortex (13% and 14%, respectively) in the brains of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients that develop amyloid plaques [88]. In another study, there was a 2.7-fold elevation of BACE protein expression in the cortex of the brains of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients compared to age-matched controls [89].

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92.

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

This inhibition could explain the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) in brains of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutation carriers. It suggests that \\u201cincreased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase\\u201d contribute to neurotoxicity and AD pathogenesis.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

We have established a novel, HiBiT tag based assay reporting on the global \\u03b3-secretase activity in cells, using as a proxy the total levels of secreted HiBiT-tagged A\\u03b2 peptides. The assay and findings are presented in the revised manuscript as follows: In the result section, in the \\u201cA\\u03b242 treatment leads to the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments in neuronal cell lines and human neuron\\u201d subsection: \\u201cThe increments in the APP-CTF/FL ratio suggested that A\\u03b242 (partially) inhibits the global \\u03b3-secretase activity. To further investigate this, we measured the direct products of the \\u03b3-secretase mediated proteolysis of APP. Since the detection of the endogenous A\\u03b2 products via standard ELISA methods was precluded by the presence of exogenous human A\\u03b242 (treatment), we used an N-terminally tagged version of APPC99 and quantified the amount of total secreted A\\u03b2, which is a proxy for the global \\u03b3secretase activity.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade.

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included.

Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism.

Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism.

However, the recent successes of A\\u03b2 targeted trials have assuaged those doubts. In this review, we discussed the evolution of the amyloid cascade hypothesis over the last 30 years and summarized its application in Alzheimer\\u2019s diagnosis and modification.

In 1984, Glenner & Wong discovered that the amyloid \\u03b2 protein (A\\u03b2) is the central component of extracellular amyloid plaques in AD.1 Since then, A\\u03b2 has been considered as a driver of Alzheimer\\u2019s pathological processes and the \\u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\\u201d has become a leading theory of AD pathogenesis.2 Over the past decades, targeting A\\u03b2 has been the main direction of developing AD treatment.3\\u20136 However, the repetitive failures of A\\u03b2-targeted clinical trials have cast considerable doubt on this hypothesis. Anti-A\\u03b2 therapy has now become a significant controversy in AD drug development and treatment. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential cleavage of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. However, the non-amyloidogenic pathway is the predominant pathway in vivo.7 APP is mostly cleaved first by \\u03b1-secretase within A\\u03b2 domain at the A\\u03b2 Leu17 site in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, generating a secreted form of APP (sAPP\\u03b1) and an 83-amino acid membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF) C83, thus precluding A\\u03b2 production. The beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the \\u03b2-secretase, and its homolog BACE2, the \\u03b8-secretase, also contribute to the non-amyloidogenic pathway.7,8 Under physiological conditions, BACE1 predominantly processes APP at the A\\u03b2 Glu11 \\u03b2-secretase site to generate C89, and \\u03b3-secretase cleaves C89 to produce a truncated A\\u03b211-40.7,8 BACE2 cleaves APP at the A\\u03b2 Phe20 \\u03b8-secretase site to generate C80 and precludes A\\u03b2 generation.9\\u201311 Two enzymatic cleavages of APP by\",\n",

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Statistical analysis was performed using Excel, GraphPad Prism, R 4.2.2. and R Studio software. The following R packages were used for the analysis: readxl, ggplot2, plyr, dplyr, DescTools, gridExtra and reshape2 (Wickham, 2016; Wickham, 2007; Wickham, 2011). p<0.05 was considered as a predetermined threshold for statistical significance.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

It also improved the memory deficits in AD model mice.317 Unfortunately, all of them have been discontinued in the clinical trials. Immunotherapy has been considered as one of the most promising strategies aimed at the modification of AD development. This approach involves designing synthetic peptides or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to decrease brain A\\u03b2 load and slow the disease progression. The first AD vaccine tested in a clinical study was AN1792, a synthetic full-length A\\u03b242 peptide.318 Although the vaccine showed some therapeutic effects, including slowed cognitive decline, the clinical trials were terminated due to the occurrence of aseptic meningoencephalitis in 6% of the participants.319\\u2013321 A possible explanation for this side effect is the induction of T helper 2 (Th2) cell responses by the excipients applied to produce C-terminus region of A\\u03b2 peptides.321 Accordingly, the subsequent vaccines do not include this region of A\\u03b2 peptides. Vanutide cridificar (ACC-001) is a conjugate of multiple short A\\u03b2 fragments to avoid the safety concerns associated with AN1792.322 Preclinical data showed that vanutide cridificar induced the generation of N-terminal anti-A\\u03b2 antibodies and successfully improved cognitive impairment in AD animal models. However, all clinical trials using vanutide cridificar were also discontinued following a serious adverse event.323 Another example is Lu AF20513, which is a mixed peptide containing three repeats of the first 12 amino acids of A\\u03b2 peptide interspersed with tetanus toxin sequences. The peptide was designed to activate a B cell response to produce polyclonal antibodies against A\\u03b2. While Lu AF20513 was shown to successfully remove brain amyloid deposits in the initial preclinical study, clinical trials were terminated due to a lack of efficacy.324 Currently, four vaccines are under the clinical trials, including ALZ-101 (Phase 1), ACI-24 (Phase 2), ABvac 40 (Phase 2) and UB311 (Phase 3). ALZ-101 is a vaccine specific to soluble A\\u03b2 oligomers rather than A\\u03b2 monomers or fibrils.325 It is undergoing a Phase 1B study. ACI-24 is a liposome vaccine based on the A\\u03b21-15 sequences. It is designed to generate antibodies specifically against the \\u03b2-sheet folding of A\\u03b2. In the preclinical studies, ACI-24 was shown to generate high titers of anti-A\\u03b2 IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies and improve novel object recognition in AD mice.324 Its Phase 2 trials have been started, in which ACI-24 becomes the first anti-A\\u03b2 vaccine to be evaluated for treating AD in Down\\u2019s syndrome patients. Another vaccine called ABvac40 targets the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 peptides and is also currently being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical studies.326 UB-311 consists of the A\\u03b21-14 peptides in combination with a Th-cell epitope, which was designed to specifically stimulate Th2 cells regulatory immune responses over Th1-mediated autoimmune responses. UB-311 was shown to neutralize A\\u03b2 toxicity and enhance plaque clearance in preclinical studies.327 In the Phase 2 studies, UB-311 also showed its safety and generated A\\u03b2 antibodies in 96% of the patients with mild AD\",\n",

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4].

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a), but kinetic modeling combined with informative site-directed mutagenesis will be important to fully unravel the function of these remarkable structures (Bhattarai et al, 2022; Chen et al, 2023; Petit et al, 2022b).

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions.

While several \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have been identified, there has been toxicity observed in clinical trials associated with non-selective enzyme inhibition. To address this, \\u03b3-secretase modulators have been identified and pursued as more selective agents. Recent structural evidence has provided an insight into how \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators are recognized by \\u03b3-secretase, providing a platform for rational drug design targeting this protease. In this study, docking- and pharmacophore-based screening approaches were evaluated for their ability to identify, from libraries of known inhibitors and modulators with decoys with similar physicochemical properties, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators. Using these libraries, we defined strategies for identifying both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators incorporating an initial pharmacophore-based screen followed by a docking-based screen, with each strategy employing distinct \\u03b3-secretase structures. Furthermore, known \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators were able to be identified from an external set of bioactive molecules following application of the derived screening strategies. The approaches described herein will inform the discovery of novel small molecules targeting \\u03b3-secretase.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u03b3-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that performs regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Type-I transmembrane (TM) proteins [1], processing over 100 functionally diverse substrates [2,3]. It is a heterotetrametric enzyme complex [4] composed of presenilin (PS, of which there are two homologues, PS1 and PS2) [5], nicastrin (Nct) [6], anterior pharynx defective-1 (Aph-1) [7], and presenilin enhancer-2 (Pen-2) [8]. The most notable substrates of \\u03b3-secretase are Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) [9] and Notch family receptors 1\\u20134 [10]. Due to its role in APP processing, \\u03b3-secretase has been investigated for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease (AD), amongst other \\u03b3-secretase related disorders [11]. These molecules are classified as \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which target the enzyme active site, and \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that bind to an allosteric site [12,13]. Numerous GSIs, including avagacestat and semagacestat [14,15], have progressed to clinical trials; however, they\",\n",

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

Modifying any of the heterocycles on E2012 could improve binding affinity and/or selectivity for imidazole-like GSMs. GSMs bind to multiple allosteric sites on \\u03b3-secretase, which in turn may alter conformation of the active site (Fig.\\u00a09B) [85]. While these structural studies will need to be supported by experimental data, they can be applied towards rational design of the next generation GSIs and GSMs for AD therapeutics. While targeting \\u03b3-secretase has proven challenging, it should not diminish its potential as a crucial target for AD pathogenesis. The serious toxicities that halted clinical studies of GSIs demonstrated there were many knowledge gaps about \\u03b3-secretase biology and underestimation of its nuanced proteolysis before the compounds were evaluated in humans [49]. GSMs aim to stimulate \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s carboxypeptidase-like trimming of A\\u03b2 peptides to their shorter, less pathogenic forms. Over the past two decades, industry and academic groups have optimized the potency and CNS penetration of GSMs, several of which have started clinical trials. The success of small molecule GSMs, as with other A\\u03b2-targeted therapies, also depend on being administered in the early stages of AD pathology well before clinical manifestations. Amyloid-based biomarkers and diagnostics will be vital to identifying and monitoring trial subjects. The development of the first GSM-based radiotracer suggests that that \\u03b3-secretase expression could be monitored in AD patients. In the past several years, detailed structures of \\u03b3-secretase have emerged. These structures have already been used in computational docking studies for GSMs [91]. Modeling GSMs with varying chemotypes could be insightful for comparing their mechanisms of recognizing and altering substrate and enzyme transmembrane domains. The latest \\u03b3-secretase structures bound to GSIs and E2012 offer a wealth of information for the design and lead optimization of more potent and substrate-selective small molecules. Drug combinations using drugs which act on distinct targets or show different mechanisms of action have been commonly been used in cancer [92]. A few combination therapies could involve (1) distinct structural classes of GSMs (2) GSMs and inhibitors of tau in neurofibrillary tangles, and (3) GSMs and agents which stimulate A\\u03b2 clearance.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for combination therapies targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation, is promising. Modulating γ-secretase activity through γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) could selectively alter Aβ processing without completely inhibiting its function, thereby minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional γ-secretase inhibitors (McGrowder et al., 2021; Molinuevo et al., 2018).\n",

The transmembrane domain (inserted in the membrane, blue) and the position of the \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated schematically. Beta-secretase is a type I transmembrane aspartyl-protease. We use in the text another name for \\u03b2-secretase i.e., BACE1 (\\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), because this name is preferred in the clinical trial literature. The \\u03b2-secretase yields a soluble APPs\\u03b2 that is secreted in the medium, and a membrane-bound APP carboxyterminal fragment that is 99 amino acid-long (APP-CTF99) and remains membrane bound. The primary amino acid sequence of APP-CTF99 is displayed and the precise positions of the \\u03b2-secretase and the consecutive \\u03b3-secretase cleavage sites are indicated. The combined actions of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretases generate A\\u03b2 peptides of different lengths, as indicated by the black lines above and below the primary amino acid sequence. The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3].

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions.

However, aberrant proteolysis of substrates has implications in the progression of disease pathologies, including Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), cancers, and skin disorders. While several \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have been identified, there has been toxicity observed in clinical trials associated with non-selective enzyme inhibition. To address this, \\u03b3-secretase modulators have been identified and pursued as more selective agents. Recent structural evidence has provided an insight into how \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators are recognized by \\u03b3-secretase, providing a platform for rational drug design targeting this protease. In this study, docking- and pharmacophore-based screening approaches were evaluated for their ability to identify, from libraries of known inhibitors and modulators with decoys with similar physicochemical properties, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators. Using these libraries, we defined strategies for identifying both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators incorporating an initial pharmacophore-based screen followed by a docking-based screen, with each strategy employing distinct \\u03b3-secretase structures. Furthermore, known \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators were able to be identified from an external set of bioactive molecules following application of the derived screening strategies. The approaches described herein will inform the discovery of novel small molecules targeting \\u03b3-secretase.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u03b3-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that performs regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Type-I transmembrane (TM) proteins [1], processing over 100 functionally diverse substrates [2,3]. It is a heterotetrametric enzyme complex [4] composed of presenilin (PS, of which there are two homologues, PS1 and PS2) [5], nicastrin (Nct) [6], anterior pharynx defective-1 (Aph-1) [7], and presenilin enhancer-2 (Pen-2) [8]. The most notable substrates of \\u03b3-secretase are Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) [9] and Notch family receptors 1\\u20134 [10]. Due to its role in APP processing, \\u03b3-secretase has been investigated for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease (AD), amongst other \\u03b3-secretase related disorders [11]. These molecules are classified as \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which target the enzyme active site, and \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that bind to an allosteric site [12,13]. Numerous GSIs, including avagacestat and semagacestat [14,15], have progressed to clinical trials; however, they\",\n",

Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",

Over 100 years ago, Alois Alzheimer described extraneuronal amyloid plaques as a signature pathological characteristic of the disease, and the discovery in the late 1980s and early 1990s that the primary protein component of the plaques is A\\u03b2 [93,94], with A\\u03b242 being the predominant species [13] and most aggregation-prone [95], led to the assumption that A\\u03b242 is the likely pathogenic species. Subsequent studies ranging from effects of APP and presenilin mutations to the neurotoxicity of various A\\u03b2 assemblies would seem to confirm this hypothesis. However, selectivity in the reporting of findings (negative results are more difficult to publish) in combination with incomplete knowledge of all forms of A\\u03b2 could result in mistaking correlation for causality. In light of more recent findings, mentioned earlier, that FAD mutations in PSEN1 increase A\\u03b2 peptide intermediates of 45 residues and longer, it would seem worthwhile to determine the effects of GSMs on the first or second trimming events of APP substrate by \\u03b3-secretase (e.g., A\\u03b249\\u219246, A\\u03b245\\u219242). The devastation of AD is severe, the numbers afflicted are large, and the need for effective therapeutics is great. Despite decades of intense efforts by laboratories around the world, in academia, government, and industry, only symptomatic treatments for AD are available, and no drugs of any kind have been approved since 2003. The large majority of clinical trials have involved agents that target A\\u03b2 in some way, to block its production or aggregation or to stimulate its clearance. \\u03b3-Secretase remains a top target, especially as altered processing of APP substrate by this protease complex is clearly involved in the pathogenesis of FAD. Dominant missense mutations in presenilins\\u2014the catalytic component of the \\u03b3-secretase complex\\u2014and APP\\u2014the \\u03b3-secretase substrate precursor to A\\u03b2\\u2014cause FAD with virtually 100% penetrance. A single mutant allele in either the enzyme or substrate that produce A\\u03b2 fates the carrier to AD in midlife. The pathology, presentation, and progression of this genetic form of the disease is essentially indistinguishable from the much more common form that strikes in late life. Thus, it seems likely that A\\u03b2 in some form similarly plays a key role in the etiology of sporadic late-onset AD. Given the close similarities between the familial and sporadic forms of the disease, elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of the former\\u2014a simpler problem\\u2014is likely to be illuminating for the latter. Early work had focused on the aggregation-prone A\\u03b242, as this A\\u03b2 variant is the principal component of the characteristic cerebral plaques of AD. In many cases, FAD mutations can elevate the ratio of A\\u03b242 to the more soluble A\\u03b240. However, processing of APP substrate by \\u03b3-secretase is complex, involving carboxypeptidase trimming of initially formed A\\u03b248 or A\\u03b249, and FAD mutations can elevate longer forms of A\\u03b2 that contain most of the APP TMD and remain membrane-bound. A critical question is whether these long A\\u03b2 peptides play an important role in the pathogenic process. A variety of substrate-based probes for \\u03b3-secretase have been developed. Transition-state analog inhibitors (TSAs) provided the first clue that the enzyme is an aspartyl protease, and affinity labeling reagents based on TSAs\",\n",

Evidence from mouse models suggest that the cognitive worsening may be due to increased \\u03b3-secretase substrates [80], although elevation of total A\\u03b2, seen in plasma at low inhibitor concentrations, may be responsible [81,82]. These findings have effectively halted further development of GSIs for AD. Interestingly though, these compounds may be repurposed for oncology, for the treatment of various cancers that involve overactive Notch signaling [83]. While GSIs are out of further consideration for AD therapeutics, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) are still of keen interest [84]. These compounds (see Figure 10 for examples) have the effect of lowering A\\u03b242 levels without decreasing overall A\\u03b2 levels or otherwise inhibiting general \\u03b3-secretase activity [85,86]. The decrease in A\\u03b242 is correlated with an increase in A\\u03b238, thereby replacing a highly aggregation-prone form of A\\u03b2 with a much more soluble form. Thus, these compounds can prevent the formation of plaques and other higher-order assembly states of A\\u03b242 in the brain. GSMs, however, have no effect, even at very high concentrations, on Notch proteolysis and signaling, nor do they elevate \\u03b3-secretase substrates. Presumably for these reasons, these compounds have shown excellent safety profiles, both in animal models and in human trials. The mechanism of action of these compounds is not entirely clear, although the correlation between A\\u03b242 lowering and A\\u03b238 elevation is relevant, as A\\u03b242 is a precursor to A\\u03b238. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves the A\\u03b242 C-terminus to release a tetrapeptide [45], and isolated \\u03b3-secretase converts synthetic A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 with release of this tetrapeptide [87]. Moreover, presenilin mutations decrease the A\\u03b242-to-A\\u03b238 conversion while GSMs stimulate it. Thus, GSMs appear to decrease A\\u03b242 by enhancing the carboxypeptidase activity of \\u03b3-secretase that converts this aggregation-prone peptide to A\\u03b238. A critical issue with GSMs, however, like all anti-A\\u03b2 therapeutic strategies, is the design of clinical trials [88]. So far, all reported clinical trials with candidate AD therapeutic agents, including GSIs, GSMs and anti-A\\u03b2 immunotherapy, have been with individuals who already have AD or a pre-AD condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Even in those with MCI, substantial neurodegeneration has occurred, and there are serious concerns that targeting A\\u03b2 after the onset of symptoms is too late. A\\u03b2 pathology in the brain may appear more than 10 years before the clinical manifestation of AD [89]. As A\\u03b2 pathology apparently precedes tau pathology [4,90], and tau pathology may then propagate from neuron to neuron [91,92], blocking A\\u03b2 after tau pathology is initiated may not prevent or slow the progression of AD and may not even prevent or delay disease onset. For anti-A\\u03b2 strategies\\u2014including GSMs\\u2014to succeed, clearer knowledge of the pathogenic process and timing is needed, as are convenient and reliable biomarkers and diagnostics. Moreover, the clinical success of GSMs is completely dependent on whether A\\u03b242 is indeed the pathogenic entity in AD. The reasons for the focus on A\\u03b242 are arguably more historic than a result of an objective search with no preconceptions.

Recently, IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3, also known as fragilis) was identified as an imidazole GSM, E2012, binding protein158. Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211. Hur et al.158 showed that IFITM3 binds to PS1-NTF in active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production (A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242) (Fig. 6). KD or KO of IFITM3 decreased A\\u03b2 production, and overexpression of IFITM3 increased A\\u03b2 levels in IFITM3 KO cells158. Moreover, crossing IFITM3 KO mice with 5XFAD Tg mice decreased A\\u03b2 production and amyloid plaque formation in the cortex and hippocampus158. Aging mouse models also showed increased IFITM3 levels, \\u03b3-secretase activity, and active IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase complex formation levels by aging158. A positive correlation between the amount of active IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase complexes and the high \\u03b3-secretase activity resulting in high A\\u03b2 production was shown in the subsets of SAD patient\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

Cerebral neurodegeneration typically takes place first in the hippocampus, a region below the neocortex that is critical for consolidating long-term memories. Neuronal loss spreads to other cortical areas, leading to progressive cognitive decline. By the end stages of the disease, patients lose cognitive function to the point of requiring constant care, often institutionalized. Although a number of risk factors have been associated with AD, disease onset correlates best with age, and the large majority of cases occur in the elderly. Among people over age 85, over a third are afflicted. Two types of protein deposits are found in the AD brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [2]. The former are extraneuronal and primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), whereas the latter are intraneuronal filaments of the normally microtubule-associated protein tau. Neuroinflammation is a third pathological feature of AD, in which microglia\\u2014phagocytic brain immune cells that release cytokines\\u2014become overactivated [3]. The role of each of these features in AD etiology and pathogenesis are not well understood. However, A\\u03b2 aggregation\\u2014in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils, and plaques\\u2014is generally observed as the earliest pathology, followed by tau tangle formation and neurodegeneration [4]. For this reason and those mentioned in the next section, pathological A\\u03b2 is widely considered the initiator of AD, triggering downstream tau pathology and neuroinflammation, and A\\u03b2 has been the primary target for the development of AD therapeutics for over 25 years [5]. As mentioned above, the \\u201camyloid hypothesis\\u201d of AD pathogenesis has reigned for decades, and AD drug development has largely focused on inhibiting A\\u03b2\",\n",

This result shows the direct link between inflammation and A\\u03b2 production via IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase in neurons158,212,213.

How \\u03b3-secretase cleaves over 100 substrates and how those signaling cascades could result in different physiological functions remain to be determined in the future. To validate \\u03b3-secretase as an A\\u03b2 modifying drug, further studies on the regulation/modulation of \\u03b3-secretase by GSMs and transiently binding GSMPs are needed. In addition, the effects of GSMs and GSMPs on different substrate processing need to be elucidated.

On the other hand, a co-immunoprecipitation study against \\u03b3-secretase complex components pulled down both active and inactive \\u03b3-secretase complexes. In animal studies, GSIs successfully reduced A\\u03b2 production. DAPT decreased A\\u03b2 levels in the plasma, CSF, or brain of AD transgenic mice117,120. Chronic treatment with LY-411,575 in AD transgenic mice reduced A\\u03b2 but also inhibited Notch signaling, leading to side effects121. Semagacestat (LY-450,139) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163) in Tg2576 mice reduced A\\u03b2 production while increasing APP-CTF122. However, those GSIs impaired normal cognition in wild-type mice122. Begacestat (GSI-953) reduced A\\u03b2 levels in Tg2576 mice123. In clinical trials, GSIs such as semagacestat (LY-450,139, Eli Lilly) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163, Bristol-Myers Squibb) reduced A\\u03b2 production in AD patients124,125. However, the multitude of \\u03b3-secretase substrates has made the development of clinically useful inhibitors difficult. Due to the decreased Notch signaling and the accumulation of APP-CTFs122, side effects such as the risk of skin cancer and infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and worsening cognition led to the pause of clinical trials5,124,125. Therefore, these GSIs are nonselective and inhibit both APP and Notch121,124,126. Avagacestat was reported as a \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI and was shown to have a higher selectivity for APP over Notch cleavage127. However, avagacestat was suggested to be nonselective later based on poor Notch-sparing activity122,128 and its binding site as PS1-NTF128. Another \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI, begacestat (GSI-953, Wyeth/Pfizer), was also discontinued in phase I clinical trial, and the reasons are unclear129. Another concern regarding GSI treatment is the A\\u03b2 rebound effect. GSIs at lower doses increased A\\u03b2 levels, and discontinuation of GSI treatment was observed with a rebound of A\\u03b2 levels130,131. These GSIs target PS1-NTF128. GSIs have been repurposed in the cancer field for Notch signaling inhibition and are currently in clinical trials. Instead of inhibiting the whole \\u03b3-secretase activity, modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity by \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) has been tested. GSMs are more attractive disease-modifying agents than GSIs because GSMs (1) inhibit selectively aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 production, (2) increase shorter A\\u03b237 or A\\u03b238 species, (3) do not affect the total A\\u03b2 production and the accumulation of APP-CTF, and (4) spare Notch processing132.

Thus, knocking out the tau genes in the APP/PS1 mice inhibited the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing, A\\u03b2 production and the amyloid plaque formation.138 Furthermore, the neurotoxicity of A\\u03b2 is tau-dependent. Absence of tau on NMDARs of spines successfully prevented the toxic effect induced by the binding of A\\u03b2 to NMDARs.92 A recent study proposed that the phosphorylation of tau at Tyr18 by Fyn kinase also blocked A\\u03b2 toxicity.139,140 A\\u03b2 promoted the phosphorylation and activation of Fyn kinase, which further migrated into dendritic spines, leading to synaptic\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

This might be mediated by a vascular inflammatory response to amyloid angiopathy aggravated by anti-A\\u03b2 antibody. If this holds true, it would seem unlikely that a similar response would be seen in people who have low or no amyloid in their brains. Perhaps a more concerning aspect is the anti-amyloid antibody-mediated increase in brain atrophy, as evidenced by MRI (Alves et al, 2023). The time course of this atrophy is discordant with the time course of amyloid removal, which is evident in the study with bapineuzumab, that barely removed any amyloid from the brain (Salloway et al, 2014). The atrophy appears to relate to the presence of a plaque-binding antibody in the brain. In fact, it is not clear whether this atrophy is even a measure of neurodegeneration in this particular context. Nevertheless, this might present an unquantifiable risk in a primary amyloid prevention study with anti-amyloid antibodies and will require post-treatment monitoring. Current agents are administered intravenously (although subcutaneous administration is being investigated). This somewhat burdensome feature is not optimal for subjects entering a primary prevention study for which multiple-year studies will be required, and does not compare favorably with the potential of a once-a-day tablet. Using these antibodies for primary prevention of AD seems, therefore, to be logistically very challenging. The insights gained by studying the FAD mutations in PSEN are pivotal in this regard, as they show that the age of disease onset is determined by the relative ratio of long A\\u03b2\\u226542 to short A\\u03b2\\u226440. Allosteric modulators of \\u03b3-secretase shift A\\u03b2 peptide production from long to short peptides, and are, therefore, fundamentally acting inversely to the causal mutations in FAD. As the mutations bring the age of onset forward, such treatment should postpone (indefinitely) the onset of disease. Gamma-secretase modulation was first demonstrated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), such as ibuprofen, indomethacine, and sulindac sulfide (Luo and Li, 2022; Weggen et al, 2001). At very high concentrations (25\\u2013300\\u2009\\u00b5m) and independently from cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition, these drugs lower significantly A\\u03b242, increase A\\u03b238, and do not affect A\\u03b240 in cell cultures and mice (Weggen et al, 2001). Tarenflurbil (R-flurbiprofen) was tested in a large phase-III trial, without success however (Green et al, 2009), likely because brain concentrations of the agent were insufficient to mediate a pharmacological effect (Karran and Hardy, 2014). In general, the first GSM generation lacked potency, and, besides some academic work (Saretz et al, 2021), this chemical space (Santiago et al, 2021; Mekala et al, 2020) has largely been abandoned. A second generation of GSMs was developed based on the carboxyl-acid moiety of the NSAID scaffold. These compounds, similar to the first-generation GSMs, selectively affect A\\u03b242/A\\u03b238, while sparing A\\u03b240. Examples of the most potent compounds in these series are EVP-0015962 (Rogers et al, 2012), GSM2 (Kretner et al, 2011), and BIIB042 (Scannevin et al, 2016), all\",\n",

Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced.

This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

In summary, biochemical studies suggest that distinct GSI and GSM modulation sites exist in PS of the \\u03b3-secretase complex: binding sites for TSA GSI and allosteric GSMs (acid GSM and imidazole GSM, respectively) (Fig. 5)132. These different classes of small molecules occupy different distinctive sites within the \\u03b3-secretase complex. Therefore, they interact and induce conformational changes in \\u03b3-secretase complexes, which lead to different A\\u03b2 cleavages132. For example, E2012-BPyne shows enhanced labeling of PS1-NTF in the presence of GSI L-685,458150. Recently, cryo-EM structure studies confirmed the different binding sites for TSA GSI (L-685,458) and imidazole GSM (E2012) found in the \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig. 5)112. L-685,458 binds the active site of PS1, while the imidazole GSM E2012 binds to the allosteric binding site in PS1112. For a non-TSA GSI, semagacestat occupies the same location as APP (C99) and Notch (N100)112. It suggests that semagacestat could block hybrid \\u03b2 sheet formation between substrates and PS1, therefore inhibiting substrate cleavages112. Another non-TSA GSI (avagacestat) also occupies a similar binding site as semagacestat except with some variations112. L-685,458, semagacestat, and avagacestat share the same binding pocket in PS1, whereas L-685,458 has an additional unique binding pocket112. Co-incubation with L-685,458 and E2012 also showed that E2012 binds to the interface between Nct and PS1 (Fig. 5)112. Yang et al.112 suggested that GSIs and GSMs could be used in combination for a synergistic effect, and this structural information could also improve the design of substrate-selective small molecules for AD. Bateman et al.153 reported that A\\u03b2 production and clearance rates per hour in human CSF are 7.6% and 8.3%, respectively. Sporadic AD (SAD) human brain gray matter has 4.8\\u2009mg more total A\\u03b2 than healthy controls154. This gives the estimated A\\u03b2 accumulation rate in the brain ~28\\u2009ng/hour, and a 2\\u20135% slight increase in A\\u03b2 deposition could lead to AD in ~20 years154. For FAD, PS FAD mutations increase the ratio of A\\u03b242/40, which leads to AD over several decades155. Therefore, reducing A\\u03b2 production by a few percent154 by modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity with GSMs and/or other means could be therapeutic for AD patients. Although PS, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 are essential subunits for \\u03b3-secretase activity50, it is plausible that other transiently binding proteins could regulate \\u03b3-secretase activity and/or substrate specificity in different types of tissues, cells, or subcellular organelles. In addition, the reported size of the \\u03b3-secretase complex varies between 200 and 2000\\u2009kDa50,52,55, indicating that there is a possibility of unknown components being present in the \\u03b3-secretase complex.

Unfortunately, little was learned from the failed trials\\u00a0(De Strooper, 2014), and \\u03b3-secretases were largely deprioritized as drug targets for the industry in the context of AD. Interestingly, the capacity of GSIs to block Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999) remained all this time of interest to companies in the context of cancer and chronic inflammation (McCaw et al, 2021; Christopoulos et al, 2021). Nirogacestat (Ogsiveo) recently became the first GSI to reach regulatory approval for rare desmoid tumors that are non-cancerous growths of the connective tissue (Gounder et al, 2023) (see Box\\u00a01). Recent success with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) in AD have considerably changed the perspective on the potential of A\\u03b2 lowering as a possible therapy for this devastating disorder (Karran et al, 2011; Karran and De Strooper, 2022). However, various aspects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy may not make them the optimal therapeutic choice for primary prevention clinical studies. A possible approach to primary prevention might be the suppression of A\\u03b2 production so that the key A\\u03b2 plaque-seeding peptides are not produced in sufficient concentrations to initiate plaque formation. While inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase or of BACE1, the other protease that is needed to release A\\u03b2 from APP (Fig.\\u00a01), remain formal possibilities, both approaches suffer from the same dilemma: can a therapeutic window be established sparing the normal functions of both enzymes? To administer agents that already carry known adverse events to normal individuals lacks clinical equipoise. Gamma-secretase allosteric stabilizers (GSAS), in contrast to \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), theoretically allow normal physiological processing of the many substrates of the \\u03b3-secretases, while enhancing the processive cleavage of the A\\u03b2 peptide, favouring the generation of shorter forms as we will discuss below. The GSASs avoid the mechanism-based side effects that precluded the clinical development of GSIs and revert the production of all long A\\u03b2 peptides to shorter forms, in contrast to the earlier \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSM) that were directed to A\\u03b242 lowering (Weggen et al, 2001; Luo and Li, 2022). In the first part of this review, we will discuss our current understanding of \\u03b3-secretases and the effect of clinical mutations on their activity, resolving ongoing controversy in the field. We will stress how novel insights from cryo-EM structures (Yang et al, 2021) and a better understanding of function\\u00a0(Petit et al, 2022a; Szaruga et al, 2017) and cell biology (Sannerud et al, 2016) of the \\u03b3-secretases have allowed insights into the mode of action of GSASs. In the second part of the review, we will use these insights to explain the mode of action of GSASs and to discuss the roadblocks to further clinical development of GSAS-based precision medicine approaches for the prevention of AD. One of the major aims of the therapeutic development of GSIs in AD was to separate Notch from APP processing. The putative Notch sparing inhibitor avagacestat (Coric et al, 2015) made it to a phase-II clinical trial but was halted because of Notch and other side effects.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242. The compound BMS-932,481 (Soares et al, 2016) had the desired effects on A\\u03b2: decreased A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, and increased A\\u03b237 and A\\u03b238 without effecting total A\\u03b2 in humans. However, liver toxicity limited the dose, and further clinical development has stopped. From the published work, compound PF-06648671 (Ahn et al, 2020) appears promising. Three phase-I clinical trials involving in total of 120 patients exposed to single and multiple-ascending doses have been reported (Ahn et al, 2020).

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

Drug candidate classes include gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs), known to lower the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio with EC50 values in the double-digit nM range, but with suboptimal drug-like properties and no human studies reported. The introduction of gamma-secretase allosteric stabilizers (GSASs) represents a significant advancement, as they stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex, increasing A\\u03b2 processivity and potentially offering a more effective therapeutic approach for AD-related neuroinflammation and tau pathology.\\n\\n8\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \" in these series are EVP-0015962 (Rogers et al, 2012), GSM2 (Kretner et al, 2011), and BIIB042 (Scannevin et al, 2016), all with EC50 values for A\\u03b242 lowering in the double-digit nM range. However, their drug-like properties were suboptimal and there are no reports of their effects in human studies (Mekala et al, 2020; Santiago et al, 2021). These first and second generations of GSMs were screened empirically using cell-based assays and focusing on their A\\u03b242-lowering properties and their capacity to maintain the \\u03b5-cleavage of \\u03b3-secretases that is critical for intracellular signaling pathways. However, the mechanism of action and the precise target of these drugs remained unclear (Kounnas et al, 2010; Kukar et al, 2008; Kretner et al, 2011; Wanngren et al, 2012). The term \\u201cGSM\\u201d is used for any compound that decreases the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio (Golde et al, 2013). This nomenclature, while useful at the outset to distinguish them from GSIs, fails to encompass our new understanding of \\u03b3-secretase enzymatic function. The identification of the third generation of GSMs provided a major step forward and the first examples of GSASs. The prototype, introduced in 2006 by Eisai (Yu et al, 2014), targets an allosteric site in the PSEN subunit (Cai et al, 2017; Yang et al, 2021). The GSASs stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex to increase A\\u03b2 peptide processivity (Fig.\\u00a01), lowering the ratio of long A\\u03b2\\u226542 to short A\\u03b2\\u226440 peptides (Szaruga et al, 2017; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al, 2012; Petit et al, 2022b). In essence, they act in the inverse manner of FAD mutations, as discussed earlier. The properties of GSASs are summarized in Table\\u00a01. We propose to restrict the use of the name \\u03b3-secretase allosteric stabilizer (GSAS) strictly to this class of novel molecules (Table\\u00a01 and Table\\u00a02). Several molecules of this class are confirmed to bind to the same allosteric site on PSEN (Takeo et al, 2014; Ebke et al, 2011; Yang et al, 2021; Petit et al, 2022b).Table 1Characteristics of a gamma-secretase allosteric modulator (GAM).Pharmacological propertiesDoes not affect the epsilon cleavage of substratesBinds an allosteric site in gamma-secretaseNo effect on total AbetaLowering effect on Abeta42 and 43No or moderate effects on Abeta 40Increasing effect on Abeta37/38No accumulation of APP-CTFMaintenance of Notch and other signaling pathwaysDrug propertiesPropertyGoodAcceptablePoorTPSA40\\u20139090\\u2013120<2020\\u201340>120H-Bond<11\\u20132>2DonorH-Bond<44\\u20138>8AcceptorMW<360360\\u2013500>500ClogP<33\\u20135>5ClogD<22\\u20134>4pKa<88\\u201310>10Kp,uu (brain)>0.3The essential pharmacological properties are summarized and defined as whether a compound can be considered an allosteric modulator of \\u03b3-secretase.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed.

While these structural studies will need to be supported by experimental data, they can be applied towards rational design of the next generation GSIs and GSMs for AD therapeutics. While targeting \\u03b3-secretase has proven challenging, it should not diminish its potential as a crucial target for AD pathogenesis. The serious toxicities that halted clinical studies of GSIs demonstrated there were many knowledge gaps about \\u03b3-secretase biology and underestimation of its nuanced proteolysis before the compounds were evaluated in humans [49]. GSMs aim to stimulate \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s carboxypeptidase-like trimming of A\\u03b2 peptides to their shorter, less pathogenic forms. Over the past two decades, industry and academic groups have optimized the potency and CNS penetration of GSMs, several of which have started clinical trials. The success of small molecule GSMs, as with other A\\u03b2-targeted therapies, also depend on being administered in the early stages of AD pathology well before clinical manifestations. Amyloid-based biomarkers and diagnostics will be vital to identifying and monitoring trial subjects. The development of the first GSM-based radiotracer suggests that that \\u03b3-secretase expression could be monitored in AD patients. In the past several years, detailed structures of \\u03b3-secretase have emerged. These structures have already been used in computational docking studies for GSMs [91]. Modeling GSMs with varying chemotypes could be insightful for comparing their mechanisms of recognizing and altering substrate and enzyme transmembrane domains. The latest \\u03b3-secretase structures bound to GSIs and E2012 offer a wealth of information for the design and lead optimization of more potent and substrate-selective small molecules. Drug combinations using drugs which act on distinct targets or show different mechanisms of action have been commonly been used in cancer [92].

Unfortunately, little was learned from the failed trials\\u00a0(De Strooper, 2014), and \\u03b3-secretases were largely deprioritized as drug targets for the industry in the context of AD. Interestingly, the capacity of GSIs to block Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999) remained all this time of interest to companies in the context of cancer and chronic inflammation (McCaw et al, 2021; Christopoulos et al, 2021). Nirogacestat (Ogsiveo) recently became the first GSI to reach regulatory approval for rare desmoid tumors that are non-cancerous growths of the connective tissue (Gounder et al, 2023) (see Box\\u00a01). Recent success with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) in AD have considerably changed the perspective on the potential of A\\u03b2 lowering as a possible therapy for this devastating disorder (Karran et al, 2011; Karran and De Strooper, 2022). However, various aspects of anti-amyloid immunotherapy may not make them the optimal therapeutic choice for primary prevention clinical studies. A possible approach to primary prevention might be the suppression of A\\u03b2 production so that the key A\\u03b2 plaque-seeding peptides are not produced in sufficient concentrations to initiate plaque formation. While inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase or of BACE1, the other protease that is needed to release A\\u03b2 from APP (Fig.\\u00a01), remain formal possibilities, both approaches suffer from the same dilemma: can a therapeutic window be established sparing the normal functions of both enzymes? To administer agents that already carry known adverse events to normal individuals lacks clinical equipoise. Gamma-secretase allosteric stabilizers (GSAS), in contrast to \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), theoretically allow normal physiological processing of the many substrates of the \\u03b3-secretases, while enhancing the processive cleavage of the A\\u03b2 peptide, favouring the generation of shorter forms as we will discuss below. The GSASs avoid the mechanism-based side effects that precluded the clinical development of GSIs and revert the production of all long A\\u03b2 peptides to shorter forms, in contrast to the earlier \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSM) that were directed to A\\u03b242 lowering (Weggen et al, 2001; Luo and Li, 2022). In the first part of this review, we will discuss our current understanding of \\u03b3-secretases and the effect of clinical mutations on their activity, resolving ongoing controversy in the field. We will stress how novel insights from cryo-EM structures (Yang et al, 2021) and a better understanding of function\\u00a0(Petit et al, 2022a; Szaruga et al, 2017) and cell biology (Sannerud et al, 2016) of the \\u03b3-secretases have allowed insights into the mode of action of GSASs. In the second part of the review, we will use these insights to explain the mode of action of GSASs and to discuss the roadblocks to further clinical development of GSAS-based precision medicine approaches for the prevention of AD. One of the major aims of the therapeutic development of GSIs in AD was to separate Notch from APP processing. The putative Notch sparing inhibitor avagacestat (Coric et al, 2015) made it to a phase-II clinical trial but was halted because of Notch and other side effects.

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3].

It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7. Both A\\u03b2 oligomers and plaques damage neurons by astrocytic activation, oxidative\",\n",

However, aberrant proteolysis of substrates has implications in the progression of disease pathologies, including Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), cancers, and skin disorders. While several \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have been identified, there has been toxicity observed in clinical trials associated with non-selective enzyme inhibition. To address this, \\u03b3-secretase modulators have been identified and pursued as more selective agents. Recent structural evidence has provided an insight into how \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators are recognized by \\u03b3-secretase, providing a platform for rational drug design targeting this protease. In this study, docking- and pharmacophore-based screening approaches were evaluated for their ability to identify, from libraries of known inhibitors and modulators with decoys with similar physicochemical properties, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators. Using these libraries, we defined strategies for identifying both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators incorporating an initial pharmacophore-based screen followed by a docking-based screen, with each strategy employing distinct \\u03b3-secretase structures. Furthermore, known \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators were able to be identified from an external set of bioactive molecules following application of the derived screening strategies. The approaches described herein will inform the discovery of novel small molecules targeting \\u03b3-secretase.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u03b3-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that performs regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Type-I transmembrane (TM) proteins [1], processing over 100 functionally diverse substrates [2,3]. It is a heterotetrametric enzyme complex [4] composed of presenilin (PS, of which there are two homologues, PS1 and PS2) [5], nicastrin (Nct) [6], anterior pharynx defective-1 (Aph-1) [7], and presenilin enhancer-2 (Pen-2) [8]. The most notable substrates of \\u03b3-secretase are Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) [9] and Notch family receptors 1\\u20134 [10]. Due to its role in APP processing, \\u03b3-secretase has been investigated for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease (AD), amongst other \\u03b3-secretase related disorders [11]. These molecules are classified as \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which target the enzyme active site, and \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that bind to an allosteric site [12,13].

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well. The compound NGP555 (Kounnas et al, 2019) demonstrated moderate pharmacodynamic effects in phase-I studies with a significant increase in A\\u03b238 but only a tendency to lower A\\u03b242.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",

Hence, MDS for AD was optimized to enhance detection by spiking synthetic A\\u03b242 into the plasma as mentioned in a recent study [15]. Therefore, in the present study, we used the optimized approach as well. The aim of the present study was to verify whether the levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers in plasma by MDS correlated well with other AD biomarkers. The levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers in the plasma by MDS were higher in the AD group than in the NC group, consistent with previous reports [9\\u201311]. We confirmed that the correlation of the plasma levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers with other conventional amyloid biomarkers was similar to that of CSF A\\u03b242 and PIB SUVR with moderately strong correlations. The present study might be the first to present a direct correlation between levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers in plasma and other amyloid biomarkers. Most studies thus far have shown no or low correlations between plasma A\\u03b240 or A\\u03b242 and CSF A\\u03b242 or PET amyloid plaques [25, 26]. However, the present results reveal that plasma levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers had a substantial correlation with CSF tau proteins, especially pTau. Previous studies have shown that levels of soluble A\\u03b2 oligomers correlated with the extent of synaptic loss and severity of cognitive impairment [7, 8], as well as that levels of tTau and pTau in CSF correlated with increased disease severity and disease progression [27, 28]. Overall, measuring the plasma levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers using the MDS technique could be associated with symptom severity, which required further investigation for its potential use in monitoring disease progression or as a prognostic biomarker of AD. The correlation analysis between plasma A\\u03b2 oligomer levels obtained using MDS and other amyloid biomarkers showed a low correlation coefficient between MDS and PIB SUVR (Additional file\\u20091: Figure S1). This result pertained to a patient who was evaluated for AD using an amyloid biomarker mismatch (Additional file\\u20091: Table S1 and Figure S2). Hence, few such unusual cases were excluded in the correlation and ROC analyses. According to published AD criteria [29], a biomarker should possess\\u2009>\\u200980% sensitivity and specificity. The plasma levels of the A\\u03b2 oligomer detected using the MDS technique did not satisfy these criteria, owing to lower sensitivity. However, the specificity exceeds 80%, and the sensitivity was close to this percentage. Initially, CSF A\\u03b242 and tau protein also showed similar lower levels of sensitivity and specificity [30, 31]; however, their levels increased as the performance of the analytical protocols improved [18, 32]. Similarly, the diagnostic value of plasma A\\u03b2 oligomers for AD will increase as the MDS technique is further refined in the future. The present study has several limitations. First, the study samples were small, owing to difficulties in obtaining willing participants for the CSF study, especially in the NC group. Because the well-characterized patients with AD were selected by experts, more reliable data on AD biomarkers were collected. The results of the present study could be supported by a larger cohort and longitudinal studies. Second, individuals with various conditions, such as mild cognitive impairment, preclinical AD, Parkinson\\u2019s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or vascular dementia, could not be included. Comparison with control samples from such diseases would help evaluate the usefulness of A\\u03b2 oligomers in the plasma as a diagnostic biomarker of AD.

The correlation coefficient indicated a moderately strong relationship between the levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers in the plasma and other AD biomarkers. The diagnostic performance of measuring plasma levels of the A\\u03b2 oligomers by MDS was also comparable with that of other conventional AD biomarkers. Thus, we investigated the possibility of using a simple blood test to verify the presence of A\\u03b2 oligomers, which is considered a core pathological feature of AD [1]. Lesn\\u00e9 et al. [6] identified three types of A\\u03b2 oligomers (A\\u03b2 dimers, A\\u03b2 trimers, and A\\u03b2*56) in brain tissue. They also analyzed the correlations between the levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers and tau proteins and concluded that the presence of A\\u03b2*56 correlated well with AD pathology. A\\u03b2 oligomers inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, which was related to synaptic loss and altered neuronal plasticity [7, 8]. On the basis of these results, A\\u03b2 oligomers have been investigated widely as therapeutic targets of AD. Because the detailed basic concept of MDS for detecting A\\u03b2 oligomers was recently published [15], the present approach of measuring A\\u03b2 oligomers by MDS was expanded to a larger cohort with clinically well-characterized patient samples for the cross-comparisons in parallel with other biomarkers, such as CSF A\\u03b2, tTau, pTau, and amyloid depositions by PIB-PET. As mentioned in the Background section, MDS required the use of epitope-overlapping antibodies against the N-terminus of A\\u03b2 for capturing and detecting the antigen in oligomeric forms. When a unique epitope on monomeric A\\u03b2 forms was bound by the capture antibody, no additional epitope would be available to the detection antibody for binding. However, A\\u03b2 oligomers with multiple copies of a unique epitope could bind both the capturing and detection antibodies, assuming free accessibility by antibodies to the binding target. In the present study, both well-characterized capturing and detection antibodies against the N-terminus A\\u03b2 were used. Therefore, the MDS would be more effective in detecting A\\u03b2 oligomers in samples than ELISAs with conformation-specific antibodies. In previous studies, plasma levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers have been analyzed using different approaches. Zhou et al. [9] reported that increased plasma levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers detected using traditional ELISA were negatively associated with cognitive function. Another research group used sandwich ELISA [10] and reported that levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers were consistently higher in both the plasma and brain tissue of patients with AD. A combination of immunoprecipitation using magnetic beads and flow cytometry was also used for detecting plasma A\\u03b2 oligomers [11], which showed that the ROC curve analysis had a specificity of 81.2% and a sensitivity of 70.6% (AUC 0.707, 95% CI 0.52\\u20130.853). In this study, we demonstrated that the MDS technique had a relatively higher diagnostic performance than the previous methods. Because authors of previous meta-analyses have not found any significant difference between the total plasma A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 levels in patients with AD and control individuals [19\\u201324], detecting crude oligomeric A\\u03b2 in plasma was a challenge, owing to its low concentrations in the blood, especially in the midst of several interfering factors at high concentrations.

The ability to measure A\\u03b2 oligomer levels in the blood would provide simple and minimally invasive tools for AD diagnostics. In the present study, the recently developed Multimer Detection System (MDS) for AD, a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring A\\u03b2 oligomers selectively, was used to detect A\\u03b2 oligomers in the plasma of patients with AD and healthy control individuals. Twenty-four patients with AD and 37 cognitively normal control individuals underwent extensive clinical evaluations as follows: blood sampling; detailed neuropsychological tests; brain magnetic resonance imaging; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurement of A\\u03b242, phosphorylated tau protein (pTau), and total tau protein (tTau); and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography. Pearson\\u2019s correlation analyses between the estimations of A\\u03b2 oligomer levels by MDS and other conventional AD biomarkers (CSF A\\u03b242, pTau, and tTau, as well as PIB standardized uptake value ratio [PIB SUVR]) were conducted. ROC analyses were used to compare the diagnostic performance of each biomarker. The plasma levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers by MDS were higher in patients with AD than in normal control individuals, and they correlated well with conventional AD biomarkers (levels of A\\u03b2 oligomers by MDS vs. CSF A\\u03b242, r\\u2009=\\u2009\\u22120.443; PIB SUVR, r\\u2009=\\u20090.430; CSF pTau, r\\u2009=\\u20090.530; CSF tTau, r\\u2009=\\u20090.604). The sensitivity and specificity of detecting plasma A\\u03b2 oligomers by MDS for differentiating AD from the normal controls were 78.3% and 86.5%, respectively. The AUC for plasma A\\u03b2 oligomers by MDS was 0.844, which was not significantly different from the AUC of other biomarkers (p\\u2009=\\u20090.250).

Static PET image acquisition for 20\\u00a0minutes was performed 40\\u00a0minutes after an intravenous bolus injection of PIB (659\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009122\\u00a0MBq) in each subject. Each PIB PET image was coregistered to T1-weighted MRI of each subject and spatially normalized to the T1-weighted brain MRI template. Then, MRI-based segmentation of cerebral gray and white matter was performed, and the mean standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated in each brain region using modified automated anatomical labeling. The mean cortical PIB SUV ratio (PIB SUVR) was calculated as the mean uptake over voxels in the prefrontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral temporal, and parietal regions of interest for each subject, divided by the mean uptake over voxels in the cerebellar gray matter. Baseline characteristics were compared between various groups of data using unpaired t and chi-square tests. For variables with a nonnormal distribution (MMSE, CSF tTau/A\\u03b242 ratio, PIB SUVR, and MDS relative light units [RLU]), the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used, and the median values were calculated. Pearson\\u2019s correlation analyses between the MDS RLU and CSF, as well as A\\u03b242 and PIB SUVR, were also conducted. Because no correlation was observed between MDS and age, a bivariate correlation analysis was performed. The ROCs were analyzed for comparing the diagnostic performance of each biomarker (MDS RLU, CSF A\\u03b242, CSF tTau/A\\u03b242, and PIB SUVR). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the AUC. In the correlation and ROC analyses, subjects without CSF or PIB PET results were excluded.

Recently, these methods have been used widely in the clinical setting; however, they have several disadvantages, such as cost, invasiveness, and interlaboratory variability. Although simple and inexpensive blood-based biomarkers would be preferable for their safety and minimal invasiveness, no such biomarker having a direct association with the pathomechanism of AD has been developed thus far [2\\u20134]. With accumulating evidence of soluble A\\u03b2 oligomers being the major toxic substances of AD pathology [5\\u20138], efforts for measuring oligomers in plasma have been increasing [9\\u201311]. Hence, the reliable measurement of A\\u03b2 oligomers in blood samples would present a noninvasive, inexpensive, and accessible method for making the AD diagnosis. A promising enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\\u2014the Multimer Detection System (MDS) for differentiating multimers from their cellular monomers\\u2014has been developed for quantifying various oligomers. MDS was originally designed to specifically detect prion oligomers in the blood from scrapie-infected animals for a scrapie blood test [12, 13]. MDS resembles a sandwich ELISA, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a01. One specific and unique epitope existed in the A\\u03b2 monomer, and multiple copies of this epitope existed in the multimers. Hence, if epitope-overlapping antibodies toward the above unique epitope were used for capturing and detecting antibodies, binding to a specific and unique epitope would generate competition between these two antibodies. In other words, the monomer would be occupied by the capturing or detection antibody but not by both. Multiple copies of the above unique epitope in multimers would allow the binding of both the capturing and detection of antibodies, which would produce detectable signals from the detection antibody.Fig. 1The Multimer Detection System concept. a Monomers are proteins with a single epitope that can be captured by an antibody (capturing antibody 6E10) attached to the surface of the plate. After the addition of a detection antibody (FF51-horseradish peroxidase [HRP]), monomer proteins cannot be detected, because the single epitope is already occupied. b Multimers with numerous epitopes can be detected by detection antibodies. The capturing and detection antibodies are different, but their epitopes overlap.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (McGrowder et al., 2021). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Molinuevo et al., 2018).\n",

Our analysis of the global \\u03b3-secretase (endopeptidase) activity in well-controlled cell-free assays, using purified protease and substrate, demonstrated that human A\\u03b242 inhibited the processing of APPC99 by all members of the human \\u03b3-secretase family. Notably, despite the high homology between human and murine A\\u03b2 sequences, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 failed to inhibit the proteolysis of APPC99, implying that structural determinants in the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 are involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Consistent with this view, N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b211\\u201342 and p3 17\\u201342) demonstrated reduced or no inhibitory properties, compared to human A\\u03b242. The p3 peptides lack the 16 amino acids long, hydrophilic, and disordered N-terminal domain present in A\\u03b2, but do contain the two aggregation-prone regions (16\\u201321 and 29\\u201342) required for the assembly of oligomers (Festa, 2019; Dulin et al., 2008) and fibrils (Higgins et al., 1996; L\\u00f3pez de la Paz and Serrano, 2004; Kuhn et al., 2020). Despite p3 peptides\\u2019 aggregation-prone behavior (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020) and their accumulation in AD brain (Higgins et al., 1996; Saido et al., 1996; Lalowski et al., 1996; Gowing et al., 1994), the neurotoxicity of these peptides is not well defined (Walsh et al., 2002). Moreover, our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter A\\u03b21-x species (x=37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human A\\u03b242. The reported lower affinities of shorter A\\u03b2 peptides towards \\u03b3-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (Szaruga et al., 2017). Our analysis on cultured neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human A\\u03b242, but not p3, resulted in the accumulation of \\u03b3-secretase substrates. This phenotype is consistent with an A\\u03b242-induced inhibitory effect on \\u03b3-secretase activity, but could also be a consequence of alterations in cellular mechanisms that define protein (substrate) steady-state levels. However, A\\u03b242 treatment did not induce significant cellular toxicity, as determined by two independent readouts, nor did it promote APP-CTF generation, as indicated by the analysis of total, soluble APP ectodomain (precursor) levels. In addition, the assessment of the APP-CTF turnover by \\u03b3-secretase and/or general degradation mechanisms defined the inhibition of endogenous \\u03b3-secretases as the most important mechanism contributing to the accumulation of APP-CTF in living neurons treated with human A\\u03b242.

Also, DLB is more common in men than in women (Walker, Possin, et al. 2015). For FTD, mutations in the C9orf72 gene are the most common genetic cause (DeJesus-Hernandez et al. 2011) followed by MAPT and GRN mutations (Rademakers et al. 2012). For Parkinson\\u2019s dementia, age (Pringsheim et al. 2014), male sex (de Lau and Breteler 2006), a history of anxiety or depression and environmental factors such as pesticide exposure, head injury and rural living (Noyce et al. 2012) are among suggested risk factors. Additionally, the APOE \\u03b54 allele may independently influence the risk of dementia in PDD (Irwin et al. 2012, 2017). The early diagnosis of AD, especially in the prodromal phase, remains difficult if only clinical symptoms are taken into consideration (Dubois et al. 2007; Aluise et al. 2008). This is reflected in general low accuracy of the clinical AD diagnostic methods in the absence of biomarker information. For logical reasons, the earlier stage of the disease, the lower is the accuracy of clinical diagnosis. As reviewed later in this paper, two neuropathologic features are consequently found in the brains of patients with AD: extracellular plaques composed of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins (Braak and Braak 1991b). Therefore, it is not surprising that these two groups of molecules are the most established biomarkers of the disease. Amyloid plaques are composed mainly of the peptides derived from the enzymatic cut of \\u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Kang et al. 1987). This transmembrane protein is encoded in humans by a gene on chromosome 21, and its alternative splicing results in at least three isoforms, with the form known as APP 695 (i.e. the one consisting of 695 amino acid residues) expressed predominantly in the brain (Panegyres 1997). The physiological role of APP is not clear so far; however, an involvement in cell-to-cell and matrix interactions is postulated. Enzymatic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase(s) followed by \\u03b3-secretase(s) leads to the release of several forms of A\\u03b2 peptides. Interestingly, the discovery of the A\\u03b2 peptides ending at different C termini leads to a conclusion that different \\u03b3-secretase activities may exist (Citron et al. 1996; Klafki et al. 1996); however, as an alternative explanation a different mechanism is postulated of the dependency of the cleavage site from the length of the intramembrane APP domain (Lichtenthaler et al. 2002). APP can also be processed by \\u03b1-secretase, which results in the release of soluble APP\\u03b1 but not A\\u03b2 peptides in the so-called \\u2018non-amyloidogenic pathway\\u2019. Interestingly, not only full-length A\\u03b2 peptides (i.e. these having aspartic acid at the N terminus position of 1) but also N-terminally shortened forms seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of AD.

Our aim was to clarify the subcellular locations of the fragments involved in the amyloidogenic pathway in primary neurons with a focus on A\\u03b242 and its immediate substrate A\\u03b2PP C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF). To overcome the difficulties of resolving these compartments due to their small size, we used super-resolution microscopy. Mouse primary hippocampal neurons were immunolabelled and imaged by stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, including three-dimensional three-channel imaging, and quantitative image analyses. The first (\\u03b2-secretase) and second (\\u03b3-secretase) cleavages of A\\u03b2PP were localized to functionally and distally distinct compartments. The \\u03b2-secretase cleavage was observed in early endosomes in soma, where we were able to show that the liberated N- and C-terminal fragments were sorted into distinct vesicles budding from the early endosomes. Lack of colocalization of A\\u03b242 and APP-CTF in soma suggested that \\u03b3-secretase cleavage occurs in neurites. Indeed, APP-CTF was, in line with A\\u03b242 in our previous study, enriched in the presynapse but absent from the postsynapse. In contrast, full-length A\\u03b2PP was not detected in either the pre- or the postsynaptic side of the synapse. Furthermore, we observed that endogenously produced and endocytosed A\\u03b242 were localized in different compartments. These findings provide critical super-resolved insight into amyloidogenic A\\u03b2PP processing in primary neurons.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nDeciphering the molecular landscape of vesicular trafficking and synaptic dysfunction is crucial for understanding the complexity of neurons in physiology and disease.

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

Irrespective of the mechanism, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms and is proposed to trigger toxic cascades via poorly understood mechanisms (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). Aggregation of A\\u03b242 into soluble toxic oligomers has been proposed as a prerequisite for its toxicity (Brinkmalm et al., 2019; Walsh et al., 2002; Hong et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017). However, given the broad spectrum of brain-derived A\\u03b2 peptides and their assemblies, it seems plausible that A\\u03b2 contributes via a number of mechanisms to AD pathogenesis. Of note, increasing evidence suggests that in addition to A\\u03b2 (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016), its precursor, the 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment (i.e. APPC99) (Lauritzen et al., 2019) also mediates pathogenic mechanisms (Xu et al., 2016; Kwart et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2016). Herein, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that pathological increases in A\\u03b2 levels in the AD brain lead to the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism, wherein A\\u03b21\\u201342 competes with membrane-associated substrates for \\u03b3-secretase processing. This hypothesis is supported by our reported observations that A\\u03b2s with low affinity for \\u03b3-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations, can compete with the longer, higher affinity APPC99 substrate for binding and processing by the enzyme (Szaruga et al., 2017). This hypothetical inhibitory feedback would result in the accumulation of unprocessed \\u03b3-secretase substrates and reduced levels of their soluble intracellular domain (ICD) products, possibly disrupting downstream signaling cascades. To test the hypothesis, we investigated whether A\\u03b2 peptides can exert inhibition on \\u03b3-secretase. Our kinetic analyses demonstrate that human A\\u03b21\\u201342 inhibits \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of APPC99 and other substrates. Strikingly, neither murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 nor human p3 (17\\u201342 amino acids in A\\u03b2) peptides exerted inhibition under similar conditions. We also show that human A\\u03b21\\u201342-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity results in the accumulation of unprocessed CTFs of APP, p75, and pan-cadherins. To evaluate the impact of the A\\u03b2-driven inhibition on cellular signaling, we analyzed p75-dependent activation of caspase 3 in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and PC12 cells. These analyses demonstrate that, as seen for \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (Franco et al., 2021), A\\u03b21\\u201342 potentiates this marker of apoptosis. Our findings thus point to an entirely novel and selective role for the A\\u03b242 peptide, and raise the intriguing possibility that compromised \\u03b3-secretase activity against the CTFs of APP and/or other substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. We have shown that A\\u03b2 peptides displaying a relatively low affinity for \\u03b3-secretase, when present at high concentrations, can compete with the higher affinity APPC99 substrate for binding to the enzyme (Szaruga et al., 2017). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that an increase in the concentration of A\\u03b242 may promote the establishment of an inhibitory mechanism that involves the formation of \\u2018non-productive\\u2019 enzyme-A\\u03b242 complexes. The A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition would result in the accumulation of unprocessed \\u03b3-secretase substrates and reduced production of their intracellular domains, both of which may contribute to dysregulated downstream signaling.

These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238.

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible.

Statistical analysis was performed using Excel, GraphPad Prism, R 4.2.2. and R Studio software. The following R packages were used for the analysis: readxl, ggplot2, plyr, dplyr, DescTools, gridExtra and reshape2 (Wickham, 2016; Wickham, 2007; Wickham, 2011). p<0.05 was considered as a predetermined threshold for statistical significance.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (McGrowder et al., 2021). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Molinuevo et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers for AD is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy. Aβ42 levels, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, have been correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline. Furthermore, the accumulation of APP-CTFs in the brain may serve as a potential biomarker for γ-secretase inhibition and neurodegeneration processes (McGrowder et al., 2021). The cyclic nature of Aβ42's inhibition on γ-secretase suggests that fluctuations in Aβ42 concentrations could be used to predict disease progression and treatment response.\n",

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD. A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone or in combination with total tau has been the most widely used biomarker to enrich the selection of participants in clinical trials. Several trials with \\u03b2-secretase inhibitors have detected a reduction in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, sAPP\\u03b2 or other subproducts of APP. Other fragments, such as A\\u03b25\\u201342, A\\u03b25-X or sAPP\\u03b1, have been found increased in CSF, suggesting an enhanced alternative processing of APP after \\u03b2-secretase inhibition. In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent. None of the trials with the active immunisation compounds showed changes in the levels of amyloid-derived CSF biomarkers. Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2. Total Tau and pTau levels have been investigated as markers of the downstream effects in anti-amyloid treatments. The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Notably, despite the high homology between human and murine A\\u03b2 sequences, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 failed to inhibit the proteolysis of APPC99, implying that structural determinants in the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 are involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Consistent with this view, N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b211\\u201342 and p3 17\\u201342) demonstrated reduced or no inhibitory properties, compared to human A\\u03b242. The p3 peptides lack the 16 amino acids long, hydrophilic, and disordered N-terminal domain present in A\\u03b2, but do contain the two aggregation-prone regions (16\\u201321 and 29\\u201342) required for the assembly of oligomers (Festa, 2019; Dulin et al., 2008) and fibrils (Higgins et al., 1996; L\\u00f3pez de la Paz and Serrano, 2004; Kuhn et al., 2020).

Moreover, our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter A\\u03b21-x species (x=37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human A\\u03b242. The reported lower affinities of shorter A\\u03b2 peptides towards \\u03b3-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (Szaruga et al., 2017). Our analysis on cultured neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human A\\u03b242, but not p3, resulted in the accumulation of \\u03b3-secretase substrates. This phenotype is consistent with an A\\u03b242-induced inhibitory effect on \\u03b3-secretase activity, but could also be a consequence of alterations in cellular mechanisms that define protein (substrate) steady-state levels. However, A\\u03b242 treatment did not induce significant cellular toxicity, as determined by two independent readouts, nor did it promote APP-CTF generation, as indicated by the analysis of total, soluble APP ectodomain (precursor) levels. In addition, the assessment of the APP-CTF turnover by \\u03b3-secretase and/or general degradation mechanisms defined the inhibition of endogenous \\u03b3-secretases as the most important mechanism contributing to the accumulation of APP-CTF in living neurons treated with human A\\u03b242.

There are two types of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, classified according to pathological factors and the age of commencement. Early-onset or familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is multifactorial and has a sporadic occurrence. These patients usually present with other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 1and 2), obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome [2]. In the second type\\u2014late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease\\u2014there is an elevation of A\\u03b242 fragment levels, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and excitotoxicity. The pathological process of late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease involves mitochondrial damage of neurons, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the vascular endothelium [19]. Existing biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease include (1) A\\u03b242 (the 42 amino acid form of amyloid \\u03b2) in CSF and (2) total and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF [20]. The utilization of these biomarkers, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, contribute to the early detection of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, with higher diagnostic certainty [21]. The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) system, a biomarker-based biological classification, was published in 2018 by a work group commissioned by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association [22]. There is a reference to A (representing amyloid plaques) and T (tau neurofibrillary tangles); these biomarkers are precise neuropathological indicators of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The \\u03b2-amyloid biomarker is assessed by measuring CSF A\\u03b242 levels using immunoassays for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry or detection of amyloid PET [23]. Phosphorylated tau has been measured extensively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or detected on tau positron emission tomography (PET) [24]. N represents biomarkers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration, which are assessed by measuring total tau in CSF by ELISA or atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; the latter not regarded as disease-specific [25]. There are respective cut-off points for A, T, and N, which are classified as normal (\\u2212) or abnormal (+), with, subsequently, eight different AT(N) biomarker profiles [26].

Studies with important findings of key CSF biomarkers are included in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Of note, key findings of meta-analysis articles are given in Table 1. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4).

Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141].

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions.

Over the last two decades, there has been significant growth in the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review presents current evidence from many clinical neurochemical studies, with findings that attest to the efficacy of existing core CSF biomarkers such as total tau, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid-\\u03b2 (A\\u03b242), which diagnose Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in the early and dementia stages of the disorder. The heterogeneity of the pathophysiology of the late-onset disease warrants the growth of the Alzheimer\\u2019s disease CSF biomarker toolbox; more biomarkers showing other aspects of the disease mechanism are needed. This review focuses on new biomarkers that track Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathology, such as those that assess neuronal injury (VILIP-1 and neurofilament light), neuroinflammation (sTREM2, YKL-40, osteopontin, GFAP, progranulin, and MCP-1), synaptic dysfunction (SNAP-25 and GAP-43), vascular dysregulation (hFABP), as well as CSF \\u03b1-synuclein levels and TDP-43 pathology. Some of these biomarkers are promising candidates as they are specific and predict future rates of cognitive decline. Findings from the combinations of subclasses of new Alzheimer\\u2019s disease biomarkers that improve their diagnostic efficacy in detecting associated pathological changes are also presented.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nDementia defines a collection of symptoms due to acquired loss of cognition in numerous domains in such a manner that affects memory, occupational function, and thinking ability. The impairment in cognition significantly interferes with an individual\\u2019s ability to maintain normal daily activity and live a fully autonomous and purposeful life [1]. Globally, Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia, encompassing 60\\u201380% of cases. It has an estimated prevalence of over 40 million individuals worldwide and is reported to be the sixth leading cause of death [2]. The incidence of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease escalates with age, especially in an aging population, and the average duration of the disease from diagnosis to death is approximately 10 years. In the United States of America, an estimated prevalence of 3% has been reported for persons 65\\u201374 years of age, 17% for 75\\u201384 years of age, and 32% for those individuals 85 years and older [3].

In addition, a meta-analysis comprising of 25 Alzheimer\\u2019s disease cohorts and 24 controls demonstrated that A\\u03b240 had a marginal size effect and, therefore, only a minor association [27]. Research has investigated the use of A\\u03b240 in assessing neuropathological changes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients [71,72]. Baiardi et al. found no significant variations in the concentrations of CSF A\\u03b240 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients and no association with amyloid deposits in the brain. However, the CSF A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio was a better predictor of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease pathology than CSF A\\u03b240 in rapidly progressive dementias [72]. There is also a report of a relationship between CSF A\\u03b240 levels and 18F-flutemetamol PET (which measures the concentrations of brain amyloid \\u03b2-protein fibrils). The correlation was more significant in apolipoprotein-E (APOE) \\u03b54 allele-negative individuals compared with APOE \\u03b54-positive subjects [73]. Furthermore, CSF A\\u03b240, along with A\\u03b242 and soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPP\\u03b2; a direct product of BACE1 enzymatic activity), may be valuable in evaluating drugs such as verubecestat, a BACE1 (aspartyl protease \\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) inhibitor that discriminatingly decreases A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients [74]. There are challenges in making a differential diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease using core CSF biomarkers as there are similarities in the patterns and symptoms of the disease with subcortical vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies [75]. In a study of 157 subjects comprising 55 sporadic Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients, 23 non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients, 45 with other neurological diseases, and 34 normal controls, Shoji and colleagues found that while A\\u03b240 levels were comparable between the groups, a decrease in A\\u03b242 levels caused a substantial elevation in the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b2 42 ratio. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio were 82% and 51%, respectively, and the authors suggested that it may be a useful biological marker of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and in the monitoring of treatment [76]. In another study that compared the accuracy of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in discriminating patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia, non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease dementia, and normal subjects, the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio categorized more patients correctly than the use of the A\\u03b242 concentration alone. The improved diagnostic accuracy of the A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratio (compared with A\\u03b242 concentration only), although not significant, was demonstrated to be 90% vs. 85% when relating Alzheimer\\u2019s disease to non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and 90.8% vs. 87% when relating Alzheimer\\u2019s disease to non-Alzheimer\\u2019s disease plus controls [77]. Likewise, in a later study, both A\\u03b238/A\\u03b2 42 and A\\u03b240/A\\u03b242 ratios were significantly different in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease patients; the latter (although not significant) differentiated persons in this group of patients from those with frontotemporal dementia.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Kakuda et al., 2021; Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Tambini et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (McGrowder et al., 2021).

Several subsequent studies have consistently shown that CSF levels of A\\u03b242 correlate inversely with plaque load as observed in autopsies and in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) [82, 114, 158, 343, 353]. CSF A\\u03b243 is also reported to decrease in AD, but it has similar diagnostic accuracy to CSF A\\u03b242 [39, 193] so research has focused on the latter. CSF A\\u03b242, together with t-tau and p-tau, are biomarkers accepted as supportive of an AD diagnosis [75, 247] (Table\\u00a02), and evidence suggests they may be prognostic of disease progression in both cognitively normal individuals [84, 209] and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [5, 9, 91, 133]. CSF A\\u03b242 has the potential to discriminate AD from FTLD but shows significant overlap with other non-AD dementias [80]. The development of automated assays to measure CSF A\\u03b242 will reduce variability among samples and laboratories and make it easier to interpret results and implement this biomarker into routine clinical practice [295]. However, several unresolved issues remain when using CSF A\\u03b242 in clinical trials. First, there needs to be a better understanding of how to interpret changes in CSF A\\u03b242 levels in AD in response to DMTs, since this is likely to vary with the mechanism of action of the DMT and with the duration of treatment. It seems logical to measure A\\u03b242 to help determine target engagement of drugs designed to reduce A\\u03b2 pathology [88, 208]; however, some trials have reported changes in CSF A\\u03b242 but no improvement in clinical endpoints [298]. Furthermore, truncated, post-translationally modified fragments of A\\u03b2 (e.g. pyroglutamate A\\u03b242) may be more prone to pathogenic aggregation [25, 117], and consideration needs to be given to what forms of A\\u03b242 are being measured. In addition, CSF A\\u03b242 remains relatively stable over time in patients with AD dementia and may have limited utility for monitoring disease progression in this group [34, 41, 367, 402]. Finally, CSF A\\u03b242 measures are influenced by pre-analytical factors such as the type of collection tube and number of freeze/thaw cycles [198, 284, 368], so it is essential to develop harmonized standard operating procedures for sample collection and handling, as established for biomarker studies in the Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [326, 327].

Next, we tested whether human A\\u03b242 exerted inhibition on all members of the \\u03b3-secretase family \\u2013 i.e. irrespective of the type of PSEN (1 vs 2) and APH1 (A vs B) subunits (Figure 1D). Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238. We note that \\u03b3-secretase processes A\\u03b243 into A\\u03b240 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5\\u20131 \\u03bcM) (30). Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u03bcM A\\u03b242, for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F).

Conversely, approximately 40% of DLB patients have AD pathology as determined by their CSF-biomarker profile [199]. Furthermore, up to half of AD patients harbour transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions that are characteristic of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [7, 50, 159]. Amylin deposits, which are found in the pancreas of most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, have also been found in AD (and type 2 diabetes) brains [157]. Thus, although AD is typically characterized by A\\u03b2 plaques and NFTs, most AD patients have multiple pathologies and different types of brain proteinopathies [21]. In the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR) Brain Bank at the University of Pennsylvania, only 35% of 247 autopsy-confirmed AD brains examined for the presence of tau, A\\u03b2, \\u03b1-synuclein, and TDP-43 deposits had only plaques and tangles as the underlying cause of dementia, while 22% had all four of these pathologies [300]. This finding emphasizes the urgent need for biomarkers that can indicate the presence of multiple pathologies in AD patients, with the methodological attributes of being reliable, accessible, and cost-efficient. The \\u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\\u201d, initially proposed in 1992 [134], but essentially embedded in the reports of the initial discovery of the partial A\\u03b2 sequence in cerebral vessels [108, 109] and the whole 4\\u00a0kDa A\\u03b2 peptide in plaques [239], is supported by genetic and biochemical data, and has been the dominant model of AD pathogenesis. The model is based on the gradual deposition of fibrillar A\\u03b2 as diffuse plaques, which triggers an inflammatory response, altered ion homeostasis, oxidative stress, and altered kinase/phosphatase activity, leading to the formation of NFTs and to widespread synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss [320]. Notably, recent experimental evidence suggests that the A\\u03b2 plaque environment can accelerate the templated spread of tau pathology [136]. Genetic data strongly implicate A\\u03b2 in AD pathogenesis [315, 390]. Whether monomeric or aggregated forms are more relevant to the neurodegenerative process remains unknown. Recent reports indicate that soluble A\\u03b2 oligomers may be more toxic than A\\u03b2 neuritic plaques [320, 321], suggesting that other forms of A\\u03b2 may be more relevant to measure. Phase 3 clinical studies of solanezumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets monomeric A\\u03b2, resulted in very modest slowing of clinical decline [72], whereas a Phase 1b study of aducanumab, a mAb that targets soluble and insoluble forms of aggregated A\\u03b2, demonstrated robust plaque reduction and a slowing of clinical decline [42, 323].

It notes that intracellular A\\u03b242 concentration increases following cellular uptake and endosomal production, which disrupts \\u03b3-secretase function, leading to the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein carboxy-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). Notably, at ~10 nM, A\\u03b242 inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in neuroblastoma cells.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The number of people living with AD is predicted to increase; however, there are no disease-modifying therapies currently available and none have been successful in late-stage clinical trials. Fluid biomarkers measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood hold promise for enabling more effective drug development and establishing a more personalized medicine approach for AD diagnosis and treatment. Biomarkers used in drug development programmes should be qualified for a specific context of use (COU). These COUs include, but are not limited to, subject/patient selection, assessment of disease state and/or prognosis, assessment of mechanism of action, dose optimization, drug response monitoring, efficacy maximization, and toxicity/adverse reactions identification and minimization. The core AD CSF biomarkers A\\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau are recognized by research guidelines for their diagnostic utility and are being considered for qualification for subject selection in clinical trials. However, there is a need to better understand their potential for other COUs, as well as identify additional fluid biomarkers reflecting other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Several novel fluid biomarkers have been proposed, but their role in AD pathology and their use as AD biomarkers have yet to be validated. In this review, we summarize some of the pathological mechanisms implicated in the sporadic AD and highlight the data for several established and novel fluid biomarkers (including BACE1, TREM2, YKL-40, IP-10, neurogranin, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, \\u03b1-synuclein, TDP-43, ferritin, VILIP-1, and NF-L) associated with each mechanism.

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Molinuevo et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

The proteolytic activity of gamma-secretase, involving several components such as presenilin and nicastrin, is influenced by the low pH in endosomal compartments where amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved. The processivity of gamma-secretase determines the length of A\\u03b2 peptides, with longer forms like A\\u03b242 associated with neurotoxicity and AD pathogenesis.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Notably, p-tau/A\\u03b242 (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 100%) was a good discriminator of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer\\u2019s disease from other dementia syndromes [36] (Table 1). Finally, Shaw et al. sought to develop a CSF biomarker signature using t-tau, p-tau, and A\\u03b242 in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative individuals (ADNI). The t-tau/A\\u03b242 ratio identified 89% of ADNI subjects with mild cognitive impairment and predicted their conversion to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [132]. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is characterized by advanced and incapacitating dementia in aging individuals, and the pathogenesis of the disease involves an irregular buildup of tau proteins and amyloid-beta peptides in the neurons and extracellular space of particular regions of the brain [133]. Vascular dysregulation has been linked to the initial pathological event that precedes amyloid-beta peptides and is a major causative factor to dementia and cognitive impairment observed in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [134]. Multifactorial mechanisms involving abnormalities in CSF and plasma biomarkers such as t-tau and p-tau and spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta peptide deposition from the ADNI cohort suggest that vascular dysregulation is the strongest and earliest pathological event concomitant with late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [135]. Significant evidence suggests that vascular dysregulation diminishes oxygen, glucose, and other important nutrients to the brain, resulting in damage to parenchymal cells and blood\\u2013brain barrier dysfunction, with subsequent indirect neurotoxic effects such as inflammation, dysregulation of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and paracellular permeability [136]. The reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxic conditions increase the buildup of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides in the brain via the stimulation of transcription of the \\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene and the \\u03b3-secretase complex [137]. Furthermore, blood\\u2013brain barrier disruption initiates cerebral microangiopathy and reduces the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides from the brain [138]. There is a minimum of three fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABPs) located in the human brain, namely, brain-type (b)-FABP, heart-type (h)-FABP, and epidermal-type (e)-FABP. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein (hFABP) is a protein of molecular weight of 25kDa, present in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells. It is secreted after an ischemic event and is regarded as an early biomarker for myocardial infarction [139]. Iturria-Medina et al. conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of a number of CSF and plasma analytes from the ADNI cohort and found abnormally high levels of hFABP that were associated with vascular dysfunction [135]. Basic experimental and epidemiological research has reported a relationship between dyslipidemia and the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [140,141]. Heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein is involved with the transportation of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and has been implicated as a biomarker of brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [142].

This results in synaptic loss, neuronal loss (notably, the temporoparietal association cortices and medial temporal lobe structures), memory impairment, and enhanced cognitive dysfunction due to progressive neuronal degeneration [17,18]. There are two types of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, classified according to pathological factors and the age of commencement. Early-onset or familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is multifactorial and has a sporadic occurrence. These patients usually present with other comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 1and 2), obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome [2]. In the second type\\u2014late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease\\u2014there is an elevation of A\\u03b242 fragment levels, resulting in the formation of amyloid plaques and excitotoxicity. The pathological process of late-onset Alzheimer\\u2019s disease involves mitochondrial damage of neurons, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in the vascular endothelium [19]. Existing biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease include (1) A\\u03b242 (the 42 amino acid form of amyloid \\u03b2) in CSF and (2) total and phosphorylated tau protein in CSF [20]. The utilization of these biomarkers, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, contribute to the early detection of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, with higher diagnostic certainty [21]. The Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration (A/T/N) system, a biomarker-based biological classification, was published in 2018 by a work group commissioned by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\\u2019s Association [22]. There is a reference to A (representing amyloid plaques) and T (tau neurofibrillary tangles); these biomarkers are precise neuropathological indicators of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. The \\u03b2-amyloid biomarker is assessed by measuring CSF A\\u03b242 levels using immunoassays for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry or detection of amyloid PET [23]. Phosphorylated tau has been measured extensively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or detected on tau positron emission tomography (PET) [24]. N represents biomarkers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration, which are assessed by measuring total tau in CSF by ELISA or atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET; the latter not regarded as disease-specific [25].

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023).

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020).

It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Alzheimer\\u2019s disease is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmark of its primary pathology involves the metabolism and extracellular deposition of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides (Figure 2) [37]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis gives credence to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, with the initial mechanistic event being the abnormal aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid (A\\u03b2) peptides where soluble oligomers are transformed into insoluble fibers or plaques [38]. The progressive A\\u03b2 plaque deposition causes neuronal damage and impairment in synaptic function, resulting in chronic neurodegeneration, as evident by cognitive impairment, and, eventually, the development of dementia [39]. The aggregation and accumulation of A\\u03b2 plaques are postulated as the main cause of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, and there is pathological, biochemical, and genetic evidence to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Evidence from clinics and laboratories globally supports the position that the disparity between production and clearance of A\\u03b2 peptides such as A\\u03b242 is the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [40]. Amyloid beta (A\\u03b2) plaques found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease consist of A\\u03b2 peptides, their main protein component. The A\\u03b2 peptides are generated in the central nervous system and comprise of 37\\u201349 amino acid residues derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase [38]. Moreover, A\\u03b2 peptides circulate in brain interstitial fluid, CSF, and plasma. The most prevalent peptide isoform present in the brain in physiological conditions is A\\u03b240 (approximately 80\\u201390%), followed by A\\u03b242 (approximately 5\\u201319%). Vascular amyloid consists predominantly of A\\u03b240, while senile plaques contain both A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 [41]. The former is fibrillogenic, moves at a faster rate, and is regarded as more hydrophobic in nature [42]. The peptide A\\u03b242 contributes significantly to amyloid angiopathy in patients with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [43]. It is the A\\u03b2 peptide that is secreted from the neurons in the highest amount, although this is dependent on synaptic activity [44]. A\\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid, in combination with p-tau and t-tau, is usually the globally accepted signature for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\\u2019s\",\n",

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

There are still some crucial issues that need to be improved in order to achieve an optimal implementation of CSF biomarkers in clinical trials. On the one hand, more observational longitudinal studies with larger sample sets are needed to determine the patterns of biomarker change along the natural course of the disease. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to harmonise the assays across different platforms and to develop international reference materials and methods and global cut-points (Carrillo et al. 2013). The publication of international recommendations to standardise pre-analytical conditions (del Campo et al. 2012; Vanderstichele et al. 2012) and the launch of global initiatives to survey and monitor inter-centre variability in analytical procedures (Mattsson et al. 2011, 2013) have been major advances in this respect. Finally, it is anticipated that as some trials show clinical benefit in the ongoing AD trials, the field will be able to draw more solid conclusions about whether CSF markers of neurodegeneration can be used alone or in combination as surrogate markers of efficacy (Box 1). In previous AD clinical trials, only half of participants selected by clinical criteria had biological evidence of AD.

In trials with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators, the changes in CSF levels of A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340 have not been consistent.

Patients treated with solanezumab showed an increase of total A\\u03b21\\u201340 and A\\u03b21\\u201342 levels in CSF following treatment, perhaps reflecting a change in the balance between fibrillar and soluble A\\u03b2.

The active A\\u03b2 immunisation study AN1792 (but not CAD106) showed that antibody responders had a reduction in CSF total Tau levels compared to those patients who received placebo. Treatment with bapineuzumab (but not solanezumab) was associated with a decrease in CSF pTau levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the purely subjective feeling of cognitive decline with still normal performance on standard cognitive tests (subjective cognitive decline, SCD) is associated with an increased risk of future cognitive decline and dementia (Mitchell et al. 2014). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the combination of SCD with biomarkers may be particularly useful to identify AD very early at the pre-MCI stage, which makes this approach highly attractive for clinical trials and dementia prevention. MRI studies have provided evidence that SCD is often associated very subtle AD-like patterns of brain atrophy (Peter et al. \",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \" 2013). Finally, in a Swedish longitudinal study of 122 SCD subjects with a 2-year follow-up, Hessen et al. (2015) observed cognitive decline in those with pathological Tau concentration at baseline. While the above studies reported prediction of decline by biomarkers in SCD subjects, a recent study from the AIBL cohort, based on amyloid PET predicted cognitive decline in healthy elderly, who were amyloid positive by SCD. The authors reported that an individual, who is amyloid positive, has an increased risk (HR=5.1) of cognitive decline, if he or she reports SCD (Buckley et al. 2016). This study confirms the model that SCD may correspond to the late stage of pre-clinical AD, at the initial stage of decompensation of brain function (Jessen et al. 2014). In recent years large-scale, multicentre studies have addressed AD biomarkers from different perspectives. The German Dementia Competence Network (DCN) was launched in 2002 by 14 academic centres of excellence in Germany and is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF). The primary goals of the DCN are, among others, (a) to establish procedures for the standardised multicenter acquisition of clinical, biological and imaging data, for centralised data management; (b) a comprehensive clinical characterisation of MCI and incipient dementia; and (c) to test whether CSF- and blood-based biological markers, as well as clinical and neuropsychological assessments, can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD over 3 years. The DCN has built a structured multicentre cohort. In 2,200 patients with MCI or mild dementia a multidimensional phenotyping with clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, blood and CSF biomarkers was performed. Clinical follow-up examinations were performed up to 3 years (Kornhuber et al. 2009). To reduce inter-laboratory variability, standards for the pre-analytical and analytical processing of biological samples (blood and CSF) have been developed as an important prerequisite for NDD (Lewczuk, Kornhuber, et al. 2006). Comprehensive biological sample characterisation allowed the world\\u2019s first successful GWAS on amyloid markers in CSF with innovative contributions to research on pathogenesis of AD (Ramirez et al. 2014). The work by Wiltfang et al. (2007) showed that the common sole determination of A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not sufficient to reflect the A\\u03b2 status, and demonstrated that a quotient consisting of A\\u03b21\\u201342 and A\\u03b21\\u201340 correlated significantly better with the degree of neurodegeneration indicated by Tau protein, than A\\u03b21\\u201342 alone. The results of this work have now been confirmed by other groups (Dorey, Perret-Liaudet, et al. 2015; Janelidze, Zetterberg, et al. 2016; Racine et al. 2016). The experience with established CSF dementia biomarkers A\\u03b21\\u201342, A\\u03b21\\u201340, Tau and pTau indicate an urgent need for additional markers, improving the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and the assessment of progression. Lewczuk et al. (2010) measured sAPP in CSF to improve NDD. The DCN cohort was also used to demonstrate A\\u03b2 peptide abnormalities in the plasma of patients with neurochemical dementia markers typical of AD. The interplay\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that the dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, particularly through the competitive inhibition by elevated levels of Aβ42, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This feedback inhibition leads to the accumulation of unprocessed substrates, such as APP-CTFs, which may contribute to neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. This model suggests that Aβ42 not only serves as a marker of disease progression but also actively participates in the disease mechanism by impairing essential signaling pathways mediated by γ-secretase (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that the concentration of Aβ42 in endosomal compartments can reach levels sufficient to inhibit γ-secretase, thereby disrupting the normal processing of APP and other substrates. This cyclical mechanism of inhibition could lead to fluctuations in γ-secretase activity, impacting critical cellular functions and contributing to the neurotoxic environment characteristic of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Molinuevo et al., 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress in understanding AD's molecular underpinnings, there remains a significant unmet medical need for effective therapies targeting the amyloid pathway. Current treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. The failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials has underscored the complexity of targeting this pathway effectively. A deeper understanding of the role of Aβ42 in modulating γ-secretase activity may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that could mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ accumulation (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifactorial nature of AD, a combination therapy approach targeting both Aβ42 levels and γ-secretase activity may prove beneficial. By modulating Aβ42 concentrations, it may be possible to restore normal γ-secretase function and reduce the accumulation of toxic substrates. This strategy could be complemented by therapies targeting tau pathology or neuroinflammation, addressing the diverse aspects of AD pathology in a synergistic manner (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "The identification of predictive biomarkers is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression. Aβ42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive decline, making it a potential biomarker for disease onset and progression. The dynamic interplay between Aβ42 and γ-secretase activity may also provide insights into disease mechanisms, offering a framework for developing new biomarkers that reflect the functional status of γ-secretase in the context of AD (Molinuevo et al., 2018).\n",

      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and tau protein levels in CSF, have shown promise in clinical settings for diagnosing AD and differentiating between its various forms. The study of Aβ43 levels and their association with amyloid plaque formation further emphasizes the need to explore additional biomarkers that reflect the complex interactions within the amyloid cascade. Understanding how these biomarkers correlate with γ-secretase activity and overall disease pathology could enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment strategies (Zoltowska et al., 2024; Molinuevo et al., 2018).\n",

      "Predictive biomarkers are essential for identifying individuals at risk for AD and monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers such as amyloid PET scans are crucial in this context. The correlation between Aβ42 levels and cognitive decline underscores its relevance as a biomarker for disease progression (Molinuevo et al., 2018). Additionally, the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) may serve as a marker for γ-secretase activity and its dysregulation in AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

The relationship between Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline further emphasizes the importance of these biomarkers in clinical practice (Molinuevo et al., 2018).

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92.

SERP1 interacts with the Aph-1a/Nct subcomplex of \\u03b3-secretase and increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 generation but reduces Notch processing208.

Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

This mechanism suggests a direct link between A\\u03b242 levels and altered \\u03b3-secretase-mediated signaling, which may affect cognitive functions tied to pathways like NOTCH signaling.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238.

Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u03bcM A\\u03b242, for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92.

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019). (A) The scheme depicts the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the generation of amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) and p3 peptides.

Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The accumulation of Aβ42 not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclic nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD. Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, particularly those related to Aβ levels and γ-secretase activity, hold significant clinical relevance. The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, the relationship between Aβ42 and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024).

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020).

It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available.

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92.

Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD.

An A\\u03b242/40 ratio increase could be due to increased A\\u03b242 production, decreased A\\u03b240 production, or a combination of both111. Analysis of the formation of substrate CTFs, ICDs, and A\\u03b2 species as the effect of FAD mutations of PSEN1 or PSEN2 on the cleavage of various \\u03b3-secretase substrates, such as APP, Notch, syndecan-3, N-cadherin, and \\u03b21-integrin, showed that different mutations had a varying effect on substrate processing, indicating \\u201cvariable\\u201d or \\u201cpartial\\u201d loss of PS protein function, and PS2 was less efficient than PS1111. Reconstitution of the PS protein from 138 PS1 FAD mutations with Aph-1aL containing \\u03b3-secretase mostly decreased the production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, increased the A\\u03b242/40 ratio, and suggested the loss of PS1 function114. However, these 138 PS1 FAD mutations also showed that different mutations displayed variations in A\\u03b242 or A\\u03b240 production (increase or decrease)114. In addition, further studies addressing the effect of PS FAD mutations on the structure of \\u03b3-secretase and how those conformational changes could affect the cleavage of different substrates by \\u03b3-secretase remain to be investigated. For instance, E280 in PS1 forms hydrogen bonds with Y159 and Y154102. PS1 E280A (the Columbian mutation) disrupts hydrogen bonds and causes a local conformational change102. Over the years, small molecule inhibitors and modulators targeting \\u03b3-secretase have been developed as potential disease-modifying agents in AD. The main goal is to target \\u03b3-secretase and reduce toxic A\\u03b242 species while sparing other substrate cleavage processing by \\u03b3-secretase. GSIs bind to the active site of PS and inhibit \\u03b3-secretase cleavage, thereby reducing total A\\u03b2 production. GSIs such as L-685,45835,115, BrA-1-Bt34, III-31C116, DAPT117, and Merck C57 as well as GSI-based chemical probes have been widely used to study \\u03b3-secretase. A GSI-based photoaffinity probe showed that <14% of PS1 is incorporated into active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and catalytically active while leaving the rest of PS1 in inactive \\u03b3-secretase complexes118. Thus, GSI-based chemical probes are critical to differentiating enzymatically active \\u03b3-secretase complexes from inactive complexes\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The accumulation of Aβ42 not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclic nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD. Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript.

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The accumulation of Aβ42 not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",

      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD. Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, particularly those related to Aβ levels and γ-secretase activity, hold significant clinical relevance. The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, the relationship between Aβ42 and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024). Understanding these biomarkers can guide clinical decisions and improve patient outcomes in AD.\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible.

Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4.

According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The accumulation of Aβ42 not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD. Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, particularly those related to Aβ levels and γ-secretase activity, hold significant clinical relevance. The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, the relationship between Aβ42 and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024).

The cyclic mechanism involves increased A\\u03b242 concentration, which inhibits \\u03b3-secretase, causing a buildup of APP carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) that disrupt signaling pathways such as NOTCH, implicated in memory formation. Endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrations reach approximately 10 nM in synaptosomes from end-stage Alzheimer\\u2019s disease brains, inhibiting \\u03b3-secretase activity.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

On the other hand, a co-immunoprecipitation study against \\u03b3-secretase complex components pulled down both active and inactive \\u03b3-secretase complexes. In animal studies, GSIs successfully reduced A\\u03b2 production. DAPT decreased A\\u03b2 levels in the plasma, CSF, or brain of AD transgenic mice117,120. Chronic treatment with LY-411,575 in AD transgenic mice reduced A\\u03b2 but also inhibited Notch signaling, leading to side effects121. Semagacestat (LY-450,139) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163) in Tg2576 mice reduced A\\u03b2 production while increasing APP-CTF122. However, those GSIs impaired normal cognition in wild-type mice122. Begacestat (GSI-953) reduced A\\u03b2 levels in Tg2576 mice123. In clinical trials, GSIs such as semagacestat (LY-450,139, Eli Lilly) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163, Bristol-Myers Squibb) reduced A\\u03b2 production in AD patients124,125. However, the multitude of \\u03b3-secretase substrates has made the development of clinically useful inhibitors difficult. Due to the decreased Notch signaling and the accumulation of APP-CTFs122, side effects such as the risk of skin cancer and infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and worsening cognition led to the pause of clinical trials5,124,125. Therefore, these GSIs are nonselective and inhibit both APP and Notch121,124,126. Avagacestat was reported as a \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI and was shown to have a higher selectivity for APP over Notch cleavage127. However, avagacestat was suggested to be nonselective later based on poor Notch-sparing activity122,128 and its binding site as PS1-NTF128. Another \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI, begacestat (GSI-953, Wyeth/Pfizer), was also discontinued in phase I clinical trial, and the reasons are unclear129. Another concern regarding GSI treatment is the A\\u03b2 rebound effect. GSIs at lower doses increased A\\u03b2 levels, and discontinuation of GSI treatment was observed with a rebound of A\\u03b2 levels130,131. These GSIs target PS1-NTF128. GSIs have been repurposed in the cancer field for Notch signaling inhibition and are currently in clinical trials. Instead of inhibiting the whole \\u03b3-secretase activity, modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity by \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) has been tested. GSMs are more attractive disease-modifying agents than GSIs because GSMs (1) inhibit selectively aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 production, (2) increase shorter A\\u03b237 or A\\u03b238 species, (3) do not affect the total A\\u03b2 production and the accumulation of APP-CTF, and (4) spare Notch processing132.

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy.

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

      "        \"original_text\": \"\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242. The IC50 values for A\\u03b211\\u201342 were reduced 1.79- and 1.31-fold (KM and saturating substrate concentrations, respectively), relative to A\\u03b242 (Figure 2B,\\nSupplementary file 1a), while the larger N-terminal truncation (of residues 1\\u201316) even further reduced the inhibitory effect to the level seen with murine A\\u03b242 (Figure 2C). Collectively, these data assign a defining role to the N-terminal region of A\\u03b2 in the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity.

NICD is translocated to the nucleus to regulate transcription genes such as Hes and Hey. Notch ligands (ex.

A membrane-bound truncated form of Notch, Notch\\u0394E substrate, is further cleaved by \\u03b3-secretase at the S3 site (S3 cleavage) and releases N\\u03b2 and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD is translocated to the nucleus to regulate transcription genes such as Hes and Hey. The common feature of PSEN1 or PSEN2 FAD mutations is the increased A\\u03b242/40 ratio. However, it has been debated whether it is due to a gain or loss of PS function that results in an increased A\\u03b242/40 ratio113. An A\\u03b242/40 ratio increase could be due to increased A\\u03b242 production, decreased A\\u03b240 production, or a combination of both111. Analysis of the formation of substrate CTFs, ICDs, and A\\u03b2 species as the effect of FAD mutations of PSEN1 or PSEN2 on the cleavage of various \\u03b3-secretase substrates, such as APP, Notch, syndecan-3, N-cadherin, and \\u03b21-integrin, showed that different mutations had a varying effect on substrate processing, indicating \\u201cvariable\\u201d or \\u201cpartial\\u201d loss of PS protein function, and PS2 was less efficient than PS1111. Reconstitution of the PS protein from 138 PS1 FAD mutations with Aph-1aL containing \\u03b3-secretase mostly decreased the production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240, increased the A\\u03b242/40 ratio, and suggested the loss of PS1 function114. However, these 138 PS1 FAD mutations also showed that different mutations displayed variations in A\\u03b242 or A\\u03b240 production (increase or decrease)114. In addition, further studies addressing the effect of PS FAD mutations on the structure of \\u03b3-secretase and how those conformational changes could affect the cleavage of different substrates by \\u03b3-secretase remain to be investigated. For instance, E280 in PS1 forms hydrogen bonds with Y159 and Y154102. PS1 E280A (the Columbian mutation) disrupts hydrogen bonds and causes a local conformational change102. Over the years, small molecule inhibitors and modulators targeting \\u03b3-secretase have been developed as potential disease-modifying agents in AD. The main goal is to target \\u03b3-secretase and reduce toxic A\\u03b242 species while sparing other substrate cleavage processing by \\u03b3-secretase. GSIs bind to the active site of PS and inhibit \\u03b3-secretase cleavage, thereby reducing total A\\u03b2 production. GSIs such as L-685,45835,115, BrA-1-Bt34, III-31C116, DAPT117, and Merck C57 as well as GSI-based chemical probes have been widely used to study \\u03b3-secretase. A GSI-based photoaffinity probe showed that <14% of PS1 is incorporated into active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and catalytically active while leaving the rest of PS1 in inactive \\u03b3-secretase complexes118.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The accumulation of Aβ42 not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD. Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, particularly those related to Aβ levels and γ-secretase activity, hold significant clinical relevance. The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, the relationship between Aβ42 and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024). Understanding these biomarkers can guide clinical decisions and improve patient outcomes in AD.\n",

The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7. Both A\\u03b2 oligomers and plaques damage neurons by astrocytic activation, oxidative\",\n",

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.

Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) (1). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid \\u03b2 (A\\u03b2) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (2). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (3, 4).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The accumulation of Aβ42 not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy. Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, particularly those related to Aβ levels and γ-secretase activity, hold significant clinical relevance. The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, the relationship between Aβ42 and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024). Understanding these biomarkers can guide clinical decisions and improve patient outcomes in AD.\n",

How \\u03b3-secretase cleaves over 100 substrates and how those signaling cascades could result in different physiological functions remain to be determined in the future. To validate \\u03b3-secretase as an A\\u03b2 modifying drug, further studies on the regulation/modulation of \\u03b3-secretase by GSMs and transiently binding GSMPs are needed. In addition, the effects of GSMs and GSMPs on different substrate processing need to be elucidated.

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

Previous clinical trials of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have failed, in large part due to the toxicity induced by lack of substrate-specific inhibition. Particularly notable is toxicity resulting from inhibition of Notch-1 cleavage, which disrupts essential signaling from this receptor.15,313 Thus, we should discover compounds that act as substrate-selective \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, which block the cleavage of C99, the immediate precursor of A\\u03b2, while allowing Notch cleavage to proceed unimpeded. Recently, a study showed that verteporfin only bound with the APP transmembrane domain rather than the transmembrane domain of the Notch-1 receptor, indicating its inhibitory effect is in a C99-specific manner.437 Our study also showed that PSEN1S169del (a deletion mutation in PSEN1 gene exon 6) has distinct effects on APP processing and Notch1 cleavage.39 This AD pathogenic mutation altered APP processing and A\\u03b2 generation without affecting Notch-1 cleavage and Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo. The results indicate that serine169 in PS1 could be a critical site as a potential target for the development of novel \\u03b3-secretase modulators without affecting Notch-1 cleavage to treat AD. A lack of selectivity is also a significant barrier to the therapeutic application of BACE1 inhibitors in AD. For instance, BACE2 is a close homolog of BACE1 but plays a neuroprotective role by inhibiting the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing7,8,10 and reducing potassium channel Kv2.1-induced neuronal apoptosis.438 Thus, a non-selective BACE1 inhibitor also inhibits BACE2\\u2019s protective functions, leading to off target side effects. Although the aspartyl protease family (e.g. BACE2, pepsin, renin, cathepsin D and cathepsin E) has conserved catalytic aspartic acid residues, the subsites in the active sites may be unique.439 Targeting these subsites to develop BACE1 inhibitors may increase their specificity. A\\u03b2-targeting antibodies also show off-target effects. A recent study identified that antibodies with Fc fragment reduced A\\u03b2 burden but also induced the engulgment of neuronal synapses by activating complement receptor 3 (CR3) or Fc\\u03b3 receptor IIB (Fc\\u03b3RIIB), which exacerbates cognitive impairment in AD mice.440 AD can be classified into a genetic and sporadic form of the disease.441 More than 99% of AD cases occur at an age >60 years in a sporadic manner, potentiated by various risk factors related to lifestyle.442 Less than 1% of all AD cases are early-onset with symptoms developed at an age of 50\\u2009s and earlier, and caused by gene mutations in APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2.7\",\n",

It is known that \\u03b3-secretase is an intramembrane protease dependent on the assembly of four subunits: Nicastrin (NCT), PS, Presenilin Enhancer-2 (Pen-2), and Anterior pharynx-defective-1 (Aph-1; De Strooper et al., 2012; Crump et al., 2013). Structures of human \\u03b3-secretase complex alone or with substrates obtained by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), have offered novel insights into the structural basis of function and recognition as well as the flexibility and complexity of this enzyme (Lu et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). Also, the endogenous \\u03b3-secretase complexes appear to range in size with different levels of activity (Gu et al., 2004; Evin et al., 2005), suggesting that different subunit stoichiometry and cofactors composition might contribute to activity and substrate specificity (Placanica et al., 2010). The mechanisms by which \\u03b3-secretase is being regulated at the cellular level have been the focus of extensive studies that uncover in part its intricate biology. The regulation of \\u03b3-secretase starts with the synthesis and assembly of the complex. The correct assembly of the \\u03b3-secretase complex is tightly regulated and requires multiple cellular events to generate the mature and active form (Takasugi et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004). While the basic functional \\u03b3-secretase complex requires at least one of each of its essential subunits (Sato et al., 2007), the existence of PS and Aph-1 isoforms (PS1/PS2 and Aph-1a/Aph-1b), as well as splice variants (Aph-1aS and Aph-1aL), introduces further permutations to the basic complex (Lai et al., 2003; Shirotani et al., 2004). Furthermore, different variations of the \\u03b3-secretase complex can exist in the same tissue and even in the same cells (Placanica et al., 2009a, b). Compartmentalization between \\u03b3-secretase and its different substrates in distinct cellular domains likely plays a role in \\u03b3-secretase substrate availability. Rather than altering \\u03b3-secretase activity to favor one substrate over another, spatial separation offers a post-translational regulation mechanism. For example, APP is processed by intracellular \\u03b3-secretase, while notch, which functions in the plasma membrane, is processed at the cell surface (Tarassishin et al., 2004). Multiple lines of evidence also suggest that lipid composition and lipid rafts which simulate the different cellular compartments directly affect the cleavage and distribution of \\u03b3-secretase. Changes to lipid composition in the membrane also impact substrate processing (Osenkowski et al., 2008) and in particular cholesterol-rich membranes are the major site of A\\u03b2 production (Wahrle et al., 2002; Marquer et al., 2014). Interestingly, a recent report suggests that not only are APP and Notch processing modulated by membrane lateral organization but also that \\u03b3-secretase can actively recruit specific membrane components that create a lipid environment favorable for substrate recognition and activity (\",\n",

Here, we identify interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as a \\u03b3-secretase modulatory protein, establishing a mechanism by which inflammation impacts A\\u03b2 generation. Inflammatory cytokines in neurons and astrocytes induce IFITM3 which binds to \\u03b3-secretase and upregulates its activity for A\\u03b2 production. IFITM3 expression is increased with aging and familial Alzheimer disease\\u2019s genes in mouse models. Furthermore, IFITM3 knock out reduces \\u03b3-secretase activity and the formation of amyloid plaques in 5XFAD mice. IFITM3 protein is upregulated in a subset of late onset AD (LOAD) patients that exhibit higher \\u03b3-secretase activity. The amount of IFITM3 in the \\u03b3-secretase complex has a strong and positive correlation with \\u03b3-secretase activity in LOAD. These findings reveal an unprecedented mechanism in which \\u03b3-secretase is modulated by IFITM3 by neuroinflammation and increases risks for AD.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u03b3-Secretase consists of four obligatory subunits, presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), Aph-1 and, Pen-24. Increasing evidence suggests \\u03b3-secretase activity can be regulated by \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins (GSMPs)5. Identification of GSMPs is enormously challenging due to the nature of their modulatory, rather than essential, role in \\u03b3-secretase activity and the manner of cellular context-dependent interaction, such as Hif1\\u03b1 under hypoxia6. \\u03b3-Secretase modulators (GSMs) that selectively reduce the production of A\\u03b242, without affecting other cleavages, have emerged as a promising strategy for AD drug development7\\u201310 and are valuable tools to study \\u03b3-secretase. We have shown that E2012-BPyne, a GSM, interacts with PS1 with a target-based approach11. In the present study, we searched for E2012-BPyne binding proteins in an unbiased manner and identified IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3). IFITM3 is an innate immune response protein known to restrict various viral infections12. We have determined that IFITM3 binds \\u03b3-secretase and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production. This study reveals an unprecedented connection between innate immunity and A\\u03b2 and strongly suggests that neuroinflammation can modulate \\u03b3-secretase production of A\\u03b2. Furthermore, IFITM3 increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production in a subpopulation of LOAD patients and, therefore, could be a potential risk factor for AD. IFITM3 may function as an immune switch to increase \\u03b3-secretase activity for production of A\\u03b2 for its anti-microbial activity13,14, and consequently, contribute to AD pathogenesis.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7.

AD pathology is characterized by the presence of extracellular plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis (Hardy and Higgins, 1992; Hardy and Selkoe, 2002), \\u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2), the major constituent of plaques, is the causative mediator driving the deterioration and neuropathology of AD.

It also improved the memory deficits in AD model mice.317 Unfortunately, all of them have been discontinued in the clinical trials. Immunotherapy has been considered as one of the most promising strategies aimed at the modification of AD development. This approach involves designing synthetic peptides or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to decrease brain A\\u03b2 load and slow the disease progression. The first AD vaccine tested in a clinical study was AN1792, a synthetic full-length A\\u03b242 peptide.318 Although the vaccine showed some therapeutic effects, including slowed cognitive decline, the clinical trials were terminated due to the occurrence of aseptic meningoencephalitis in 6% of the participants.319\\u2013321 A possible explanation for this side effect is the induction of T helper 2 (Th2) cell responses by the excipients applied to produce C-terminus region of A\\u03b2 peptides.321 Accordingly, the subsequent vaccines do not include this region of A\\u03b2 peptides. Vanutide cridificar (ACC-001) is a conjugate of multiple short A\\u03b2 fragments to avoid the safety concerns associated with AN1792.322 Preclinical data showed that vanutide cridificar induced the generation of N-terminal anti-A\\u03b2 antibodies and successfully improved cognitive impairment in AD animal models. However, all clinical trials using vanutide cridificar were also discontinued following a serious adverse event.323 Another example is Lu AF20513, which is a mixed peptide containing three repeats of the first 12 amino acids of A\\u03b2 peptide interspersed with tetanus toxin sequences. The peptide was designed to activate a B cell response to produce polyclonal antibodies against A\\u03b2. While Lu AF20513 was shown to successfully remove brain amyloid deposits in the initial preclinical study, clinical trials were terminated due to a lack of efficacy.324 Currently, four vaccines are under the clinical trials, including ALZ-101 (Phase 1), ACI-24 (Phase 2), ABvac 40 (Phase 2) and UB311 (Phase 3). ALZ-101 is a vaccine specific to soluble A\\u03b2 oligomers rather than A\\u03b2 monomers or fibrils.325 It is undergoing a Phase 1B study.

In the preclinical studies, ACI-24 was shown to generate high titers of anti-A\\u03b2 IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies and improve novel object recognition in AD mice.324 Its Phase 2 trials have been started, in which ACI-24 becomes the first anti-A\\u03b2 vaccine to be evaluated for treating AD in Down\\u2019s syndrome patients. Another vaccine called ABvac40 targets the C-terminus of A\\u03b2 peptides and is also currently being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical studies.326 UB-311 consists of the A\\u03b21-14 peptides in combination with a Th-cell epitope, which was designed to specifically stimulate Th2 cells regulatory immune responses over Th1-mediated autoimmune responses. UB-311 was shown to neutralize A\\u03b2 toxicity and enhance plaque clearance in preclinical studies.327 In the Phase 2 studies, UB-311 also showed its safety and generated A\\u03b2 antibodies in 96% of the patients with mild AD\",\n",

      "        \"original_text\": \"1 is incorporated into active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and catalytically active while leaving the rest of PS1 in inactive \\u03b3-secretase complexes118. Thus, GSI-based chemical probes are critical to differentiating enzymatically active \\u03b3-secretase complexes from inactive complexes119. On the other hand, a co-immunoprecipitation study against \\u03b3-secretase complex components pulled down both active and inactive \\u03b3-secretase complexes. In animal studies, GSIs successfully reduced A\\u03b2 production. DAPT decreased A\\u03b2 levels in the plasma, CSF, or brain of AD transgenic mice117,120. Chronic treatment with LY-411,575 in AD transgenic mice reduced A\\u03b2 but also inhibited Notch signaling, leading to side effects121. Semagacestat (LY-450,139) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163) in Tg2576 mice reduced A\\u03b2 production while increasing APP-CTF122. However, those GSIs impaired normal cognition in wild-type mice122. Begacestat (GSI-953) reduced A\\u03b2 levels in Tg2576 mice123. In clinical trials, GSIs such as semagacestat (LY-450,139, Eli Lilly) and avagacestat (BMS-708,163, Bristol-Myers Squibb) reduced A\\u03b2 production in AD patients124,125. However, the multitude of \\u03b3-secretase substrates has made the development of clinically useful inhibitors difficult. Due to the decreased Notch signaling and the accumulation of APP-CTFs122, side effects such as the risk of skin cancer and infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and worsening cognition led to the pause of clinical trials5,124,125. Therefore, these GSIs are nonselective and inhibit both APP and Notch121,124,126. Avagacestat was reported as a \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI and was shown to have a higher selectivity for APP over Notch cleavage127. However, avagacestat was suggested to be nonselective later based on poor Notch-sparing activity122,128 and its binding site as PS1-NTF128. Another \\u201cNotch-sparing\\u201d GSI, begacestat (GSI-953, Wyeth/Pfizer), was also discontinued in phase I clinical trial, and the reasons are unclear129. Another concern regarding GSI treatment is the A\\u03b2 rebound effect. GSIs at lower doses increased A\\u03b2 levels, and discontinuation of GSI treatment was observed with a rebound of A\\u03b2 levels130,131. These GSIs target PS1-NTF128. GSIs have been repurposed in the cancer field for Notch signaling inhibition and are currently in clinical trials. Instead of inhibiting the whole \\u03b3-secretase activity, modulating \\u03b3-secretase activity by \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) has been tested. GSMs are more attractive disease-modifying agents than GSIs because GSMs (1) inhibit selectively aggregation-prone A\\u03b242 production, (2) increase shorter A\\u03b237 or A\\u03b238 species, (3) do not affect the total A\\u03b2 production and the accumulation of APP-CTF, and (4) spare Notch processing132. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and sulindac sulfide, were found to modulate \\u03b3-secretase and represent first-generation GSMs (NSAID-derived carboxylic acid GSMs)132. These NSAIDs lowered A\\u03b242 and increased A\\u03b238 without affecting Notch cleavage133. This A\\u03b2 modulation was not due to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity, the pharmacological target of NSAIDs133. Sulindac sulfide treatment showed a varying degree of A\\u03b242 reduction levels while increasing high A\\u03b238 levels in cells overexpressing PS1 FAD mutants134.

The \\u03b3-secretase complex (Fig.\\u00a02), which is also an aspartyl-protease, cleaves APP-CTF99 first close to the intracellular site of the cell membrane to generate A\\u03b249 and AICD50-99 (49-production line), or A\\u03b248 and AICD49-99 (48-production line). The AICD is released in the cytoplasm, while the A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249 remain associated with the \\u03b3-secretase complex. The A\\u03b2 peptides are further trimmed by consecutive cleavages by \\u03b3-secretase removing tri- or tetrapeptides at each step (Takami et al, 2009). Alzheimer\\u2019s disease-causing mutations in the presenilin subunit of the \\u03b3-secretase complex destabilize the interaction with the A\\u03b2 peptides increasing the chance of premature release of incompletely digested A\\u03b2 species. This results in relative shifts of long versus short A\\u03b2 peptides, as explained in the text. Under physiological conditions, the most abundant peptide generated in this process is A\\u03b240, and clinical mutations increase the release of A\\u03b242 and/or A\\u03b243. However, currently, only A\\u03b237, A\\u03b238, A\\u03b240, A\\u03b242, and A\\u03b243 can be efficiently measured by ELISA, and the existence of other longer peptides in vivo remains to be proven. Evidence as discussed in the main text indicates, however, that the ratio of short (A\\u03b237\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b238+A\\u03b240) over long (A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009A\\u03b243) correlates linearly (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.78, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) with the age of onset of familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease in presenilin mutation carriers (Petit et al, 2022a). While these early breakthroughs created enthusiasm for the development of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI), a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of this intriguing class of proteases was lacking. Ultimately this contributed to their failure in the clinic, largely due to unexpected adverse drug effects on the skin, the vascular and immune system, and cognition (Doody et al, 2013; Coric et al, 2015). A fundamental problem was the lack of selectivity of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors that target all four \\u03b3-secretase isoforms. This blanket inhibition affected the proteolytic processing of hundreds of substrates in parallel (Hou et al, 2023), making it impossible to find an acceptable efficacy/side effect therapeutic window.

We review here the structure, function, and pathobiology of \\u03b3-secretases, with a focus on how mutations in presenilin genes result in early-onset AD. Significant progress has been made in generating compounds that act in a manner opposite to pathogenic presenilin mutations: they stabilize the proteinase-substrate complex, thereby increasing the processivity of substrate cleavage and altering the size spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides produced. We propose the term \\u201c\\u03b3-secretase allosteric stabilizers\\u201d (GSAS) to distinguish these compounds from the rather heterogenous class of GSM. The GSAS represent, in theory, a precision medicine approach to the prevention of amyloid deposition, as they specifically target a discrete aspect in a complex cell biological signalling mechanism that initiates the pathological processes leading to Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. This review explains how allosteric stabilizers of \\u03b3-secretase may prevent Alzheimer\\u2019s disease by specifically exerting opposite effects as pathogenic presenilin mutations. \\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) arguably represents one of the biggest unmet medical needs of our time. It is a complex disorder that evolves from a clinically silent biochemical phase during which amyloid plaques accumulate, to a cellular phase driven by neuroinflammation and Tau aggregation, ultimately causing synaptic dysfunction and cell death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The clinical phase of the disease starts decades after the initial biochemical phase and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration leading to dementia and death. Therapeutic strategies are likely to produce greater clinical benefit if they are administered as early as possible in the disease process, as recent successful trials with anti-amyloid antibodies (Sims et al, 2023; van Dyck et al, 2023) have demonstrated. Ideally, therapeutic intervention would prevent the first pathognomonic sign of AD\\u2014amyloid aggregation and the early cellular response to it\\u2014thus preventing irreversible damage to the brain. The discovery that presenilins (PSEN) are responsible for the \\u03b3-secretase-mediated cleavage of the membrane carboxyterminal fragments (Fig.\\u00a01) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the generation of the amyloid peptide (A\\u03b2) provided a breakthrough in AD research (De Strooper et al, 1998). This finding unified the two major causes of inherited familial AD (FAD), i.e. mutations in the APP or the PSEN genes, in one molecular process: A\\u03b2 generation. It seemed also to provide a clear drug target for the field. At about the same time, it was demonstrated that presenilins/\\u03b3-secretases release the intracellular domain of Notch, which then travels to the nucleus and regulates Notch signaling (De Strooper et al, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).\",\n",

The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023). A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown. While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease. Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients. Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a), but kinetic modeling combined with informative site-directed mutagenesis will be important to fully unravel the function of these remarkable structures (Bhattarai et al, 2022; Chen et al, 2023; Petit et al, 2022b).

Until so far, no mutations have been found in \\u03b2-secretase, but the Swedish and the Leuven APP mutations are known to shift the cleavage from the \\u03b2\\u2032-site to the \\u03b2-site, thus leading to a much higher C99 and A\\u03b2 production (12, 13, 37, 38). Inversely, the Icelandic mutation (A673T) seems to be protective against AD by decreasing \\u03b2-secretase cleavage and thus reducing by 40% the amyloidogenic fragments sAPP\\u03b2 and A\\u03b2 (17, 39). The first hint of the identity of the protease yielding the C-terminal end of A\\u03b2, the \\u03b3-secretase, was the discovery in 1995 of presenilin 1 (PS1) (40, 41, 42) and its family member presenilin 2 (PS2) (43, 44) proposed to constitute this enzyme (Fig.\\u00a02A). The definitive demonstration that presenilins could be involved in \\u03b3-secretase activity came from subsequent functional characterization showing that their depletion fully prevents A\\u03b2 production (45, 46). However, later studies revealed that \\u03b3-secretase is a multiproteic complex built of not only PS1 or PS2 but also of nicastrin, the anterior pharynx defective 1\\u00a0(Aph1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (47, 48, 49) (Fig.\\u00a02B), but the exact molecular structure of this complex was revealed by crystallography only in 2014 (50). Further studies also revealed a very complex cleavage of APP-CTFs by \\u03b3-secretase, since it takes place within the membrane and successively at several sites (\\u025b, \\u03b6-, \\u03b3- and \\u03b3\\u2032). The first endopeptidase cleavage (\\u025b-cleavage) can occur at two distinct sites leading to the generation of A\\u03b248 and A\\u03b249, which is then shortened by sequential carboxypeptidase cleavages (trimming) at \\u03b6, \\u03b3-and \\u03b3\\u2032-sites, occurring at each three or four residues and via two distinct product lines (A\\u03b249 > A\\u03b246 > A\\u03b243 > A\\u03b240 > A\\u03b237) or (A\\u03b248 > A\\u03b245 > A\\u03b242 > A\\u03b238) and the final occurrence of peptides of varying lengths but two major species of 40 or 42 amino acid residues, respectively (51).

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4].

The prototypes E2012 and E2212 have been tested in human phase-I trials demonstrating target engagement (Table\\u00a01). Trialing of E2012 was halted because of non-mechanism-based toxicity (cataracts in rats). Although E2122 was initially proposed as a safer alternative (Yu et al, 2014), undisclosed reasons have also halted the clinical development of E2122. A large variety of similar heterocyclic phenylimidazole compounds have been generated, but clinical progress was limited mostly because of non-mechanism-based liver toxicity (Mekala et al, 2020). Nevertheless, as indicated in Table\\u00a02, these are potent compounds (low single-digit nanomolar range in cell culture experiments), which decrease plaque formation and improve behavior in preclinical models of AD (for example (Kounnas et al, 2010; Rynearson et al, 2021)), while some show little preclinical toxicity as well.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7. Both A\\u03b2 oligomers and plaques damage neurons by astrocytic activation, oxidative\",\n",

Currently, a range of plasma biomarkers are being explored that correlate well with brain amyloid status (Jack et al, 2023). Recently, also an elevation in plasma pTau231 has shown utility in identifying amyloid-positive subjects, and plasma pTau231 levels with Z-scores\\u2009=\\u20092 correlated with an amyloid level of 26 CLs (Mil\\u00e0-Alom\\u00e0 et al, 2022). Thus, including participants with pTau231 Z- scores >1\\u2009<\\u20092 could be employed as a secondary filter. The amyloid PET ligand with the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics is 18F-NAV4694 (Krishnadas et al, 2022; Rowe et al, 2016), which can detect very early amyloid deposition. Trial participants would have their amyloid PET status confirmed using 18F-NAV4694, with patients with >30 Centiloids being excluded. Based on the ApoE4-positive control subjects with baseline amyloid levels <12 CL, a group size of 143 subjects would be required to demonstrate a 75% reduction of amyloid accrual in a study of 2 years\\u2019 duration1. Gamma-secretase research peaked in 2012 with 765 publications, but has drastically slowed down over the last years. It seems crucial that this work gets again the attention needed as understanding the role of these complexes in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Cancer could provide therapeutics in two major areas of medical need. Important areas of research are:The (patho-)biological function of the small peptides generated by \\u03b3-secretases from its many substrates. Accurate measurement methods are available only for A\\u03b2, with the exception of A\\u03b2\\u226543 forms. Sensitive assays of the whole spectrum of A\\u03b2 peptides and an understanding of their physiological roles are needed. Additionally, more work on the hundreds of \\u03b3-secretase substrates and their metabolites are required (Hou et al, 2023).A major question is how \\u03b3-secretase processivity is affected by endogenous or exogenous stimuli. The membrane localization of \\u03b3-secretase determines its activity (Thathiah et al, 2013). In neurons, electrophysiological activity can modulate long versus short A\\u03b2 ratio (Dolev et al, 2013). The innate immunity protein IFITM3 regulates its activity (Hur et al, 2020). The potential relevance of all these effects remains, however, largely unknown.While an understanding of the heterogeneity of the \\u03b3-secretases exists (Box\\u00a01), there is a lack of insight into the biological relevance of different \\u03b3-secretase complexes in health and disease.Patients with familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease have the classical signs of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, but many present with additional phenotypes. Understanding whether other substrates are affected by the presenilin mutations will help us to understand better the normal functions of \\u03b3-secretases and will help to develop better medication for these patients.Dynamic studies of the \\u03b3-secretase complexes and how allosteric modulation affects the enzymatic activity of those enzymes are needed. The cryo-EM structures have provided deep insight into the previously elusive intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. Nevertheless, these structures provide only snapshots of a complex multi-step process. Intermediary structures must exist, for instance, when the substrate docks to the complex. Cryo-EM approaches might elucidate such intermediary structures (Bai et al, 2015a),\",\n",

Another environmental factor, such as stress, activates G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as \\u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\\u03b22-AR) and \\u03b4-opioid receptor205. \\u03b22-AR agonists stimulate A\\u03b2 production via (1) the association with PS1, (2) the endocytosis of the receptor, and (3) the trafficking of \\u03b3-secretase to late endosomes and lysosomes205. High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92. Overexpression of GPR3 increased (1) the expression of mature \\u03b3-secretase complexes at 440\\u2009kDa, (2) the localization of \\u03b3-secretase complexes to lipid rafts, and (3) A\\u03b2 and AICD production, but (4) did not change Notch cleavage92. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with GPR3 KO mice also decreased A\\u03b2 production, and GPR3 was expressed in the brains of SAD patients92. GPCRs require adaptor proteins such as arrestins to prevent further G protein-mediated signaling206. \\u03b2-Arrestin1 is highly expressed in the brain206, and \\u03b2-arrestin1 KO mice exhibit reduced A\\u03b2 production and spared Notch cleavage207. \\u03b2-arrestin1 interacts only with Aph-1 in \\u03b3-secretase, and overexpression of \\u03b2-arrestin1 enhanced mature \\u03b3-secretase complex formation at 440\\u2009kDa207. KO of \\u03b2-arrestin1 in APP/PS1 mice decreased A\\u03b2 production and improved memory deficits207. Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) was also reported to regulate the assembly of \\u03b3-secretase complexes and contribute to A\\u03b2 pathogenesis208. SERP1 interacts with the Aph-1a/Nct subcomplex of \\u03b3-secretase and increases \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 generation but reduces Notch processing208. Recently, IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3, also known as fragilis) was identified as an imidazole GSM, E2012, binding protein158. Photolabeling with E2012-BPyne (an E2012-based photoaffinity probe) followed by LC-MS/MS identified IFITM3 at 15\\u2009kDa as a GSMP158. IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211. Hur et al.158 showed that IFITM3 binds to PS1-NTF in active \\u03b3-secretase complexes and regulates \\u03b3-secretase activity for A\\u03b2 production (A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242) (Fig. 6).

Moreover, crossing IFITM3 KO mice with 5XFAD Tg mice decreased A\\u03b2 production and amyloid plaque formation in the cortex and hippocampus158. Aging mouse models also showed increased IFITM3 levels, \\u03b3-secretase activity, and active IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase complex formation levels by aging158. A positive correlation between the amount of active IFITM3-\\u03b3-secretase complexes and the high \\u03b3-secretase activity resulting in high A\\u03b2 production was shown in the subsets of SAD patient\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The accumulation of Aβ42 not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy. Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, particularly those related to Aβ levels and γ-secretase activity, hold significant clinical relevance. The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, the relationship between Aβ42 and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024). Understanding these biomarkers can guide clinical decisions and improve patient outcomes in AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "This hypothesis underscores the potential of targeting γ-secretase to modulate Aβ42 production, aiming to mitigate its neurotoxic effects while preserving the cleavage of other essential substrates that are vital for normal cellular functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current landscape of Alzheimer's disease treatment reveals a significant unmet medical need, as existing therapies primarily provide symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying neurodegenerative processes. The inability to halt or reverse AD progression necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the root causes of the disease. Modulating γ-secretase activity presents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. By selectively reducing Aβ42 production while maintaining the processing of other crucial substrates, such as Notch, there is potential to develop treatments that could alter the disease course rather than merely alleviating symptoms (Hur, 2022).\n",

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Next, we tested whether human A\\u03b242 exerted inhibition on all members of the \\u03b3-secretase family \\u2013 i.e. irrespective of the type of PSEN (1 vs 2) and APH1 (A vs B) subunits (Figure 1D). Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of \\u03b3-secretases in the presence of 3 \\u03bcM human A\\u03b242. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (acting also as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of transmembrane substrates when present at relatively high concentrations. To gain further insights, we investigated \\u03b3-secretase mediated processing of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b238 under the conditions used to examine APPC99, using the latter as a positive control (Figure 1E). Despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A\\u03b242 (10 \\u03bcM), this peptide was not converted into A\\u03b238. In contrast, proteolytic reactions using APPC99 (1.5 \\u03bcM) resulted in the generation of A\\u03b238 (0.5\\u20131 nM). We also tested whether A\\u03b242 served as a substrate in conditions that mimic a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (Figure 1E) (30, 45). As in the detergent conditions, A\\u03b242 was barely converted into A\\u03b238. We note that \\u03b3-secretase processes A\\u03b243 into A\\u03b240 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5\\u20131 \\u03bcM) (30). Taken together, these observations indicate that exogenous A\\u03b242 does interact with \\u03b3-secretases but, unlike A\\u03b243, does not act as a substrate (at least under these conditions), supporting the notion that A\\u03b242-driven inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases is mediated via the formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes. However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u03bcM A\\u03b242, for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u03bcM \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u03bcM APPC99 for 40 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1. Two major pathological hallmarks of AD are senile plaques, which result from extracellular accumulation and deposition of amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2), and neurofibrillary tangles containing the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons2,3. AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain is the primary cause of AD7. The chronic imbalance between the production and clearance rate of A\\u03b2 may lead to increased A\\u03b242 levels, followed by A\\u03b2 oligomerization, fibril formation, and accumulation in plaques7. Both A\\u03b2 oligomers and plaques damage neurons by astrocytic activation, oxidative\",\n",

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

It notes that reduced \\u03b3-secretase activity may occur as a \\\"transient\\\" response to increased A\\u03b2 due to impaired clearance, linking A\\u03b242 levels to \\u03b3-secretase dysfunction. The study suggests that the isolation of \\u03b3-secretase might restore normal activity in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations, indicating a potential mechanism for loss-of-function phenotypes. This relationship sheds light on how A\\u03b242 and \\u03b3-secretase activity could serve as biomarkers or targets for AD treatment.\\n\\n7\": {\n",
      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis. A\\u03b2 peptides were purchased from rPeptide, resuspended in DMSO at 500 \\u03bcM, aliquoted into single use 10 \\u03bcl aliquots and stored at \\u201380 \\u00b0C.

Modulating γ-secretase activity presents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention.

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways (Zoltowska et al., 2024). The accumulation of Aβ42 not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy. Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Analysis of the levels of the de novo generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected before (reaction 1) and after washes (reaction 2) indicated that A\\u03b242 inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase is fully reversible (Figure 1F). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242. The IC50 values for A\\u03b211\\u201342 were reduced 1.79- and 1.31-fold (KM and saturating substrate concentrations, respectively), relative to A\\u03b242 (Figure 2B,\\nSupplementary file 1a), while the larger N-terminal truncation (of residues 1\\u201316) even further reduced the inhibitory effect to the level seen with murine A\\u03b242 (Figure 2C). Collectively, these data assign a defining role to the N-terminal region of A\\u03b2 in the inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity.

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

One-way or two-way ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunnett\\u2019s, Tukey\\u2019s, or Dunn multiple comparison test or unpaired Student\\u2019s t-test were used, as described in the legends. In this manuscript, the authors tested the hypothesis that A\\u03b242 toxicity arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. The authors provide useful findings, showing convincingly that human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity. The data will be of interest to all scientists working on neurodegenerative diseases. Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

      "        \"original_text\": \" 2023). Irrespective of the mechanism, the accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the brain begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms and is proposed to trigger toxic cascades via poorly understood mechanisms (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). Aggregation of A\\u03b242 into soluble toxic oligomers has been proposed as a prerequisite for its toxicity (Brinkmalm et al., 2019; Walsh et al., 2002; Hong et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017). However, given the broad spectrum of brain-derived A\\u03b2 peptides and their assemblies, it seems plausible that A\\u03b2 contributes via a number of mechanisms to AD pathogenesis. Of note, increasing evidence suggests that in addition to A\\u03b2 (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016), its precursor, the 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment (i.e. APPC99) (Lauritzen et al., 2019) also mediates pathogenic mechanisms (Xu et al., 2016; Kwart et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2016). Herein, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that pathological increases in A\\u03b2 levels in the AD brain lead to the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism, wherein A\\u03b21\\u201342 competes with membrane-associated substrates for \\u03b3-secretase processing. This hypothesis is supported by our reported observations that A\\u03b2s with low affinity for \\u03b3-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations, can compete with the longer, higher affinity APPC99 substrate for binding and processing by the enzyme (Szaruga et al., 2017). This hypothetical inhibitory feedback would result in the accumulation of unprocessed \\u03b3-secretase substrates and reduced levels of their soluble intracellular domain (ICD) products, possibly disrupting downstream signaling cascades. To test the hypothesis, we investigated whether A\\u03b2 peptides can exert inhibition on \\u03b3-secretase. Our kinetic analyses demonstrate that human A\\u03b21\\u201342 inhibits \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of APPC99 and other substrates. Strikingly, neither murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 nor human p3 (17\\u201342 amino acids in A\\u03b2) peptides exerted inhibition under similar conditions. We also show that human A\\u03b21\\u201342-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity results in the accumulation of unprocessed CTFs of APP, p75, and pan-cadherins. To evaluate the impact of the A\\u03b2-driven inhibition on cellular signaling, we analyzed p75-dependent activation of caspase 3 in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and PC12 cells. These analyses demonstrate that, as seen for \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (Franco et al., 2021), A\\u03b21\\u201342 potentiates this marker of apoptosis. Our findings thus point to an entirely novel and selective role for the A\\u03b242 peptide, and raise the intriguing possibility that compromised \\u03b3-secretase activity against the CTFs of APP and/or other substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. We have shown that A\\u03b2 peptides displaying a relatively low affinity for \\u03b3-secretase, when present at high concentrations, can compete with the higher affinity APPC99 substrate for binding to the enzyme (Szaruga et al., 2017). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that an increase in the concentration of A\\u03b242 may promote the establishment of an inhibitory mechanism that involves the formation of \\u2018non-productive\\u2019 enzyme-A\\u03b242 complexes. The A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition would result in the accumulation of unprocessed \\u03b3-secretase substrates and reduced production of their intracellular domains, both of which may contribute to dysregulated downstream signaling. As a first step, we investigated the effects of human A\\u03b21\\u201342 (from now on referred to\",\n",

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways. This inhibition not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy. Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",

The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, the relationship between Aβ42 and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024).

However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A\\u03b242 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for \\u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A\\u03b242, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on \\u03b3-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of \\u03b3-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of A\\u03b2, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of A\\u03b2 on \\u03b3-secretases. We show that human A\\u03b242 peptides, but neither murine A\\u03b242 nor human A\\u03b217\\u201342 (p3), inhibit \\u03b3-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A\\u03b242 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A\\u03b242 contribute to cellular toxicity via the \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A\\u03b2 toxicity in the context of \\u03b3-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\u0393-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez and Szaruga, 2020). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b3-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone A\\u03b2 peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). In addition, \\u03b3-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011; G\\u00fcner and Lichtenthaler, 2020). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013; Carroll and Li, 2016), including those critical for neuronal function. It is noteworthy that treatments with \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (Doody et al., 2013), while full genetic inhibition of these enzymes in the adult mouse brain led to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004; Bi et al\",\n",

However, a scenario wherein A\\u03b242 interacts with APPC99 to reduce the amount of free APPC99 substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage is not excluded by these data. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of A\\u03b242 on \\u03b3-secretase were reversible. To this end, we conjugated purified \\u03b3-secretase complexes to beads using a high-affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody and incubated the enzyme-conjugated beads with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99, in the absence or presence of 3 \\u00b5M A\\u03b242, for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C. Note that this concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (Figure 1B). As a control, 10 \\u00b5M \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After the incubation, we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer, and re-incubated them with 0.4 \\u00b5M APPC99 for 40 min at 37 \\u00b0C.

Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A\\u03b242 forms a non-productive E-S-like complex with \\u03b3-secretase and its binding is reversible. We then investigated the structure-function relationships relevant to the A\\u03b242-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A\\u03b242 and N-terminally truncated human A\\u03b2x-42 (11\\u201342 and 17\\u201342) peptides on \\u03b3-secretase activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 \\u03bcM to 10 \\u03bcM (Figure 2A\\u2013C). Quantification of the de novo AICD product levels showed that murine A\\u03b242 maximally inhibited \\u03b3-secretase activity by ~20% (Figure 2A). As three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 peptides (Figure 1A), the differences in the inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A\\u03b2 as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. It is noteworthy that similar to human A\\u03b21\\u201342, murine A\\u03b21\\u201342 was not processed to A\\u03b21\\u201338 (Figure 1\\u2014figure supplement 1B). The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A\\u03b2x-42 peptides, generated by \\u03b2-secretase (alternative) cleavage at the position 11 or by \\u03b1-secretase cut at the position 17 in the A\\u03b2 sequence, showed that the truncated peptides exhibited reduced inhibitory potencies relative to A\\u03b242.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D).

Using highly purified recombinant \\u03b3-secretase, we examined the effect of 138 AD-derived presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations on the production of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240). These 138 mutations cover virtually all AD-targeted amino acids in PS1. Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

      "### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways. This inhibition not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy. Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, particularly those related to Aβ levels and γ-secretase activity, hold significant clinical relevance. The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Summary: Human Abeta42 inhibits gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. Strengths: Determination of inhibitory concentration human Abeta42 on gamma-secretase activity in biochemical assays. The following is the authors\\u2019 response to the original reviews. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors): Major concerns: (1) It is not clear about the biological significance of the inhibitory effects of human Abeta42 on gammasecretase activity. As the authors mentioned in the Discussion, it is plausible that Abeta42 may concentrate up to microM level in endosomes. However, subsets of FAD mutations in APP and presenilin 1 and 2 increase Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and lead to Abeta42 deposition in brain. APP knock-in mice NLF and NLGF also develop Abeta42 deposition in age-dependent manner, although they produce more human Abeta42 than human Abeta40. If the production of Abeta42 is attenuated, which results in less Abeta42 deposition in brain. So, it is unlikely that human Abeta42 interferes gamma-secretase activity in physiological conditions. This reviewer has an impression that inhibition of gamma-secretase by human Abeta42 is an interesting artifact in high Abeta42 concentration. If the authors disagree with this reviewer's comment, this manuscript needs more discussion in this point of view. We thank the Reviewer for raising this key conceptual point, we acknowledge that it was insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. In response to this point, we introduced the following paragraph in the discussion section of the revised manuscript: \\u201cFrom a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and 10D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general).

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

Despite considerable interest in developing \\u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics for the treatment of AD, the precise mechanism by which \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 has remained elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that \\u03b3-secretase catalysis is driven by the stabilization of an enzyme-substrate scission complex via three distinct amino-acid-binding pockets in the enzyme\\u2019s active site, providing the mechanism by which \\u03b3-secretase preferentially cleaves APP in three amino acid increments. Substrate occupancy of these three pockets occurs after initial substrate binding but precedes catalysis, suggesting a conformational change in substrate may be required for cleavage. We uncover and exploit substrate cleavage preferences dictated by these three pockets to investigate the mechanism by which familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease mutations within APP increase the production of pathogenic A\\u03b2 species. DOI:\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17578.001 Individuals with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease generally have deposits known as \\u201camyloid plaques\\u201d in the brain. These plaques are made up of a mixture of molecules called amyloid beta peptides that clump together and are thought to be a key cause of the disease. The amyloid beta peptides vary in size; the larger peptides tend to be more prone to forming clumps than the smaller ones and are thus more toxic to the brain. An enzyme called gamma-secretase makes amyloid beta peptides by cutting up a protein called APP. Proteins are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids and studies using a technique called mass spectrometry show that gamma-secretase cuts APP in segments of three amino acids at a time. The size of the amyloid beta peptides produced is determined by the positions in APP that gamma-secretase selects to cut. Therefore, understanding how the enzyme works could provide new opportunities for developing drugs to treat Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Here, Bolduc et al. found that the human gamma-secretase enzyme has sites that amino acids in APP can bind to that help to guide the enzyme to cut APP by three amino acids at a time. These binding sites control where the enzyme cuts APP and therefore determines which amyloid peptides are produced. Previous studies have linked several naturally occurring mutations in the gene encoding APP to inherited forms of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Bolduc et al. now reveal that several of these mutations affect the places that gamma-secretase cuts APP to produce amyloid peptides. These findings may be helpful for developing drugs that could manipulate gamma-secretase to produce smaller, less harmful amyloid peptides. Gamma-secretase can cut many other proteins, and so a future challenge will be to find out if the enzyme cuts these other proteins in the same way that it cuts APP.

Our results reveal no significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant with a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients carrying this mutation. The comprehensive characterization of pathogenic PS1 mutations serves as a valuable resource for the analysis of \\u03b3-secretase activities and AD pathogenesis. A hallmark of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the aggregation of \\u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\\u03b2) into amyloid plaques in patient brain. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease \\u03b3-secretase produces A\\u03b2 of varying lengths, of which longer peptides such as A\\u03b242 are thought to be more harmful. Increased ratios of longer A\\u03b2s over shorter ones, exemplified by the ratio of A\\u03b242 over A\\u03b240, may lead to formation of amyloid plaques and consequent development of AD. In this study, we analyzed 138 reported mutations in human presenilin-1 (PS1) by individually reconstituting the mutant PS1 proteins into anterior-pharynx\\u2013defective protein 1 (APH-1)aL\\u2013containing \\u03b3-secretases and examining their abilities to produce A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 in vitro. About 90% of these mutations lead to reduced production of A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240. Notably, 10% of these mutations result in decreased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratios. There is no statistically significant correlation between the A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio produced by a \\u03b3-secretase variant containing a specific PS1 mutation and the mean age at onset of patients from whom the mutation was isolated.\\n\\nFull Text:\\n\\n\",\n",

The A\\u03b242/40 ratio is particularly important; mutations in presenilin and APP that increase this ratio are linked to familial AD. \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have faced challenges due to toxicities from inhibiting other substrates like Notch. \\\"Elucidation of this basic mechanism...may also aid in the development of safe and effective disease-modifying therapeutics.\\\"\\n\\n7\": {\n",

These plaques are comprised of aggregates of A\\u03b2 peptides, which are formed by the sequential cleavage of the membrane embedded amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two proteases\\u2014\\u03b2-secretase first removes the ectodomain of APP, then \\u03b3-secretase cleaves the remaining C-terminal fragment within its transmembrane domain (TMD) to liberate A\\u03b2 from cellular membranes. Via its proteolytic component presenilin (Li et al., 2000; Wolfe et al., 1999), \\u03b3-secretase processes the TMD of APP into A\\u03b2 peptides of differing lengths, mostly producing a more benign A\\u03b2 species 40 amino acids in length, termed A\\u03b240, as well as lesser amounts of a longer, more aggregation prone and pathogenic species, A\\u03b242. The total amount of A\\u03b242, as well as the ratio of A\\u03b242/40, are thought to be key mediators of A\\u03b2 pathogenesis, a hypothesis strongly supported by the fact that nearly all the 200-plus autosomal-dominant familial Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin-1, -2 and APP increase the A\\u03b242/40 ratio (see www.alzforum.org/mutations). Due to the strong link between \\u03b3-secretase catalyzed A\\u03b2 formation and AD pathogenesis, the development of \\u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics has been of high interest over the past two decades (Golde et al., 2013; De Strooper, 2014). Both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and a \\u03b3-secretase modulator (GSM), the latter working by an unknown mechanism to influence \\u03b3-secretase to produce shorter, presumably less pathogenic A\\u03b2 species, have failed in recent clinical trials. The failure of GSIs is due at least in part to toxicities from cleavage inhibition of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates such as Notch (Doody et al., 2013; Golde et al., 2013). Little is known about how \\u03b3-secretase recognizes the transmembrane domain of substrates, given that no consensus amino acid cleavage motif has been identified for the more than one hundred \\u03b3-secretase substrates discovered to date (Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011). Unfortunately, the further development of safe and effective \\u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics has been held back by a fundamental lack of understanding of how \\u03b3-secretase recognizes and cleaves the TMDs of its many substrates, especially APP. Elucidation of this basic mechanism should at the very least add to our understanding of how A\\u03b2 is produced and may also aid in the development of safe and effective disease-modifying therapeutics. Mass spectrometry studies have identified a complex mixture of products generated from \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s cleavage of the transmembrane domain of APP (Matsumura et al., 2014). Looking at the formation of these products over time, it is apparent that the TMD of APP is mostly processed via two major pathways. \\u03b3-secretase predominantly initiates endoproteolysis at a so-called epsilon (\\u03b5) cleavage site\\u2014after Leu49 or Thr48, generating A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 and two different APP intracellular domains (AICD), AICD 50\\u201399 or AICD 49\\u201399, respectively (Kakuda et al., 2006; Sato et al., 2003). A\\u03b249 and A\\u03b248 are then sequentially cleaved in increments of three amino acids to produce mostly A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242, respectively (Takami et al., 2009). The two major pathways are therefore A\\u03b249 \\u2192 A\\u03b246 \\u2192 A\\u03b243 \\u2192 A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b248 \\u2192 A\\u03b245 \\u2192 A\\u03b242 (Figure 1A) (Fernandez et al., 2014; Takami et al., 2009).

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

      "\n",
      "The hypothesis posits that dysregulation of γ-secretase activity, primarily through the accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 peptide, contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aβ42, generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase, has been shown to inhibit γ-secretase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to a feedback mechanism that exacerbates cellular toxicity and disrupts critical signaling pathways. This inhibition not only contributes to amyloid plaque formation but also impairs the processing of other important substrates, such as Notch, thereby affecting neuronal health and function (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "The unmet medical need is substantial, as current therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying biochemical dysregulation associated with AD. There is a critical requirement for therapeutic strategies that can effectively modulate γ-secretase activity without causing adverse effects related to Notch signaling disruption. This is particularly relevant considering the adverse outcomes observed in clinical trials with γ-secretase inhibitors that indiscriminately block all γ-secretase activity (Hur, 2022).\n",

      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for effective treatments targeting γ-secretase is evident, given the limited success of existing therapies. Current approaches often fail to prevent the progression of neurodegeneration associated with AD, highlighting the necessity for innovative strategies that can selectively modulate γ-secretase activity. The dual role of γ-secretase in both Aβ production and the processing of other critical substrates necessitates a nuanced approach to therapy that minimizes side effects while effectively reducing Aβ levels (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",

      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy targeting γ-secretase alongside other pathways involved in AD pathology may enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, pairing γ-secretase modulators with agents that promote Aβ clearance or improve synaptic function could provide a comprehensive approach to managing AD. The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy. Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, particularly those related to Aβ levels and γ-secretase activity, hold significant clinical relevance. The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, the relationship between Aβ42 and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024). Understanding these biomarkers can guide clinical decisions and improve patient outcomes in AD.\n",

      "This hypothesis underscores the potential of targeting γ-secretase to modulate Aβ42 production, aiming to mitigate its neurotoxic effects while preserving the cleavage of other essential substrates that are vital for normal cellular functions.\n",

      "In conclusion, γ-secretase represents a promising target in Alzheimer's disease due to its crucial role in the generation of Aβ peptides and its involvement in essential signaling pathways. Developing therapies that modulate γ-secretase activity could address significant unmet medical needs and enhance patient outcomes in the context of AD.\n",

The cyclical nature of Aβ42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase suggests that therapeutic interventions could be timed to coincide with fluctuations in Aβ levels, optimizing treatment outcomes (Zoltowska et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for AD progression and treatment response are crucial for personalized medicine approaches. Elevated levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its accumulation in plaques are established biomarkers of AD (Zoltowska et al., 2024). Furthermore, the correlation between Aβ42 levels and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity presents a potential predictive biomarker for assessing therapeutic efficacy. Identifying biomarkers that reflect changes in γ-secretase activity and downstream signaling pathways could enhance our ability to monitor disease progression and treatment response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, particularly those related to Aβ levels and γ-secretase activity, hold significant clinical relevance. The accumulation of Aβ42 is a hallmark of AD pathology, and its levels can be indicative of disease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, the relationship between Aβ42 and the inhibition of γ-secretase activity provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies (Hur, 2022; Zoltowska et al., 2024). Understanding these biomarkers can guide clinical decisions and improve patient outcomes in AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, γ-secretase represents a promising target in Alzheimer's disease due to its crucial role in the generation of Aβ peptides and its involvement in essential signaling pathways. Developing therapies that modulate γ-secretase activity could address significant unmet medical needs and enhance patient outcomes in the context of AD.\n",

High-throughput functional genomics screening identified another GPCR, orphan GPR3, that modulates A\\u03b2 production92.

IFITM3 plays a role in innate immunity as an antiviral protein that restricts viral protein entry into host cell membranes by inhibiting membrane fusion209. IFITM3 KO mice are susceptible to viral infections210. Previously, microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed 19.9- and 3.4-fold increases in IFITM3 in SAD brains211.

The underlying mechanisms by which the deficits in \\u03b3-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined. \\u0393-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (Maesako et al., 2022). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the proteolytic processing of APP by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (\\u03b2-CTF or APPC99) (Vassar et al., 1999). APPC99 is then sequentially processed within the membrane by \\u03b3-secretase complexes (Figure 1A; Takami et al., 2009; Bolduc et al., 2016; Ch\\u00e1vez-Guti\\u00e9rrez et al., 2012; Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Funamoto et al., 2004). An initial endopeptidase (\\u03b5-) cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a de novo substrate (either A\\u03b249 or A\\u03b248 peptide) that undergoes successive \\u03b3-cleavages until a shortened A\\u03b2 peptide can be released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) determines the length of A\\u03b2 (37\\u201343 amino acid long peptides), which in turn influences the aggregation and neurotoxic properties of the peptides produced (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016; Kakuda et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by \\u03b1- and \\u03b3-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1\\u201316 amino acids of A\\u03b2 (Figure 1A). Despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation-prone behavior, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (Kuhn and Raskatov, 2020; Lichtenthaler, 2011; Tambini et al., 2020). In fact, mutations that promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP are associated with AD (Mullan et al., 1992; Pagnon de la Vega et al., 2021), whereas those that favor the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (Tambini et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2019).

In 2021, AD and other dementias cost $355 billion in healthcare, and these costs could exceed $1 trillion by 2050 [1]. Early symptoms include memory loss and behavioral changes; in late stages of AD cognitive decline interferes with most everyday activities. While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists alleviate cognitive and behavior symptoms [2], there are no treatments which delay or stop disease progression. Earlier this year the FDA approved aducanumab, the first novel therapy for AD in almost two decades. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody which targets aggregated amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2), reduced amyloid plaques in the brain, and is expected to delay cognitive decline [2, 3]. AD pathology is characterized by the deposition of A\\u03b2 plaques in brain tissue [4].

Equally intriguing is the possibility that the general inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase substrates by A\\u03b242 could contribute to neuroinflammation by modifying microglia biology (Hou et al., 2023) and neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (Acx et al., 2017; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Saura et al., 2004). From a mechanistic standpoint, the competitive nature of the A\\u03b242-mediated inhibition implies that it is partial, reversible, and regulated by the relative concentrations of the A\\u03b242 peptide (inhibitor) and the endogenous substrates (Figure 10C and D). The model that we put forward is that cellular uptake, as well as endosomal production of A\\u03b2, result in increased intracellular concentration of A\\u03b242, facilitating \\u03b3-secretase inhibition and leading to the buildup of APP-CTFs (and \\u03b3-secretase substrates in general). As A\\u03b242 levels fall, the augmented concentration of substrates shifts the equilibrium towards their processing and subsequent A\\u03b2 production. As A\\u03b242 levels rise again, the equilibrium is shifted back towards the inhibition. This cyclic inhibitory mechanism will translate into pulses of (partial) \\u03b3-secretase inhibition, which will alter \\u03b3-secretase mediated-signaling (arising from increased CTF levels at the membrane or decreased release of soluble intracellular domains from substrates). These alterations may affect the dynamics of systems oscillating in the brain, such as NOTCH signaling, implicated in memory formation, and potentially others (related to e.g. cadherins, p75, or neuregulins). It is worth noting that oscillations in \\u03b3-secretase activity induced by treatment with a \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor semagacestat have been proposed to have contributed to the cognitive alterations observed in semagacestat-treated patients in the failed Phase-3 IDENTITY clinical trial (Doody et al., 2013) and that semagacestat, like A\\u03b242, acts as a high affinity competitor of substrates (Koch et al., 2023). The convergence of A\\u03b242 and tau at the synapse has been proposed to underlie synaptic dysfunction in AD (McInnes et al., 2018; Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2007; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), and recent assessment of APP-CTF levels in synaptosome-enriched fractions from healthy control, SAD, and FAD brains (temporal cortices) has shown that APP fragments concentrate at higher levels in the synapse in AD-affected than in control individuals (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023). Our analysis adds that endogenous A\\u03b242 concentrates in synaptosomes derived from end-stage AD brains to reach ~10 nM, a concentration that in CM from human neurons inhibits \\u03b3-secretase in PC12 cells (Figure 7). Furthermore, the restricted localization of A\\u03b2 in endolysosomal vesicles, within synaptosomes, likely increases the local peptide concentration to the levels that inhibit \\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of substrates in this compartment. In addition, we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose.

However, the repeated failures of A\\u03b2-targeted clinical trials have cast considerable doubt on the amyloid cascade hypothesis and whether the development of Alzheimer\\u2019s drug has followed the correct course. However, the recent successes of A\\u03b2 targeted trials have assuaged those doubts. In this review, we discussed the evolution of the amyloid cascade hypothesis over the last 30 years and summarized its application in Alzheimer\\u2019s diagnosis and modification.

In 1984, Glenner & Wong discovered that the amyloid \\u03b2 protein (A\\u03b2) is the central component of extracellular amyloid plaques in AD.1 Since then, A\\u03b2 has been considered as a driver of Alzheimer\\u2019s pathological processes and the \\u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\\u201d has become a leading theory of AD pathogenesis.2 Over the past decades, targeting A\\u03b2 has been the main direction of developing AD treatment.3\\u20136 However, the repetitive failures of A\\u03b2-targeted clinical trials have cast considerable doubt on this hypothesis. Anti-A\\u03b2 therapy has now become a significant controversy in AD drug development and treatment. A\\u03b2 is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential cleavage of \\u03b2- and \\u03b3-secretase. However, the non-amyloidogenic pathway is the predominant pathway in vivo.7 APP is mostly cleaved first by \\u03b1-secretase within A\\u03b2 domain at the A\\u03b2 Leu17 site in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, generating a secreted form of APP (sAPP\\u03b1) and an 83-amino acid membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF) C83, thus precluding A\\u03b2 production. The beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the \\u03b2-secretase, and its homolog BACE2, the \\u03b8-secretase, also contribute to the non-amyloidogenic pathway.7,8 Under physiological conditions, BACE1 predominantly processes APP at the A\\u03b2 Glu11 \\u03b2-secretase site to generate C89, and \\u03b3-secretase cleaves C89 to produce a truncated A\\u03b211-40.7,8 BACE2 cleaves APP at the A\\u03b2 Phe20 \\u03b8-secretase site to generate C80 and precludes A\\u03b2 generation.9\\u201311 Two enzymatic cleavages of APP by\",\n",

One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is senile plaques containing amyloid \\u03b2-peptide (A\\u03b2). A\\u03b2 is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, and the polymerization of A\\u03b2 into amyloid plaques is thought to be a key pathogenic event in AD. Since \\u03b3-secretase mediates the final cleavage that liberates A\\u03b2, \\u03b3-secretase has been widely studied as a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. \\u03b3-Secretase is a transmembrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, which are sufficient for \\u03b3-secretase activity. \\u03b3-Secretase cleaves >140 substrates, including APP and Notch. Previously, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were shown to cause side effects in clinical trials due to the inhibition of Notch signaling. Therefore, more specific regulation or modulation of \\u03b3-secretase is needed. In recent years, \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed. To modulate \\u03b3-secretase and to understand its complex biology, finding the binding sites of GSIs and GSMs on \\u03b3-secretase as well as identifying transiently binding \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins have been of great interest. In this review, decades of findings on \\u03b3-secretase in AD are discussed. Drugs that only affect the activity of an enzyme called \\u03b3-secretase but do not entirely block its function could provide a safer therapeutic option for preventing the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain linked to AD. Dr. Ji-Yeun Hur from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA, discusses the functions of \\u03b3-secretase, which include cleaving amyloid precursor proteins into smaller fragments that can aggregate to form sticky plaques, and reviews attempts to develop therapies directed against the enzyme. Early drug candidates proved too toxic because they blocked all functions of \\u03b3-secretase including desirable functions, leading to side effects. Newer drug strategies have focused on changing how \\u03b3-secretase processes Alzheimer\\u2019s-related proteins without disrupting its other physiological functions. A better understanding of \\u03b3-secretase\\u2019s complex structure and various functions could inform those strategies.\\n\\nFull Text:\\nAlzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia1.

AD progresses slowly, and the progression is estimated to occur 25 years prior to the onset of symptoms4. The current treatment for AD is to use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for the symptomatic improvement of AD5, and there is no cure available. Recently, aducanumab targeting A\\u03b2 aggregates in the brain6 was approved with some controversy.

      "        \"original_text\": \", we argue that the deposition of A\\u03b242 in plaques may be preceded by a critical increase in the levels of A\\u03b2 present in endosomes and the cyclical inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity that we propose. Under this view, reductions in \\u03b3-secretase activity may be a (transient) downstream consequence of increases in A\\u03b2 due to failed clearance, as represented by plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis. The A\\u03b2-mediated inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (Pera et al., 2013). In this regard, the direct quantification of \\u03b3-secretase activity in detergent-resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall \\u03b3-secretase activity levels, indicating that the wild-type (PSEN1 and PSEN2) \\u03b3-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (Szaruga et al., 2015). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (Ferrer-Ravent\\u00f3s, 2023; Pera et al., 2013) and the accumulation of APP-CTFs appears to correlate with A\\u03b2 levels at the synapse. The inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase by A\\u03b242 could resolve the apparent conflict. Indeed, our data could reconcile these two seemingly exclusive hypotheses on the effects of FAD mutations in PSEN1 on the development of AD by noting that: (1) there is a mutation-driven enhanced generation of A\\u03b242 within the endolysosomal network; (2) that through both endosomal production and endocytosis A\\u03b242 increases to a level within the endolysosomal network sufficient to inhibit the \\u03b3-secretase complex; and (3) that in the case of FAD mutations the isolation of the \\u03b3-secretase releases A\\u03b242, thus restoring wild-type enzyme activity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Shen and Kelleher, 2007). Thus, increased levels of endolysosomal A\\u03b242 with concurrent inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase may be responsible, at least in part, for the apparent \\u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes. Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that increases in A\\u03b242 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A\\u03b2-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical \\u03b3-secretase signaling functions. By mechanistically connecting elevated A\\u03b242 levels with the accumulation of multiple \\u03b3-secretase substrates, our observations integrate disparate views as to which pathways lead to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigating the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.

Created with BioRender.com Mutations in PS1 and PS2 have been linked to early-onset familial AD. To date more than 300 mutations for PS1 and PS2 have been reported [29, 30]. While the mechanism by which these mutations cause FAD pathogenesis has been widely investigated, two theories have been proposed: the amyloid hypothesis and the presenilin hypothesis. The amyloid hypothesis suggests that PS1 and PS2 FAD increase A\\u03b242 production, which leads to neuronal cell death and dementia. These mutations are observed to increase the ratio of A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 [31]; the relative increase in A\\u03b242 production is more prone to aggregation and formation of amyloid fibrils in the brain [28]. The presenilin hypothesis suggests that loss of presenilin function in the brain triggers FAD. Presenilin was demonstrated as essential for learning, memory, and neuronal survival [32]. \\u03b3-Secretase is regulated by many intricate mechanisms, ranging from the assembly of active and mature complexes to spatial compartmentalization and lipid composition [33, 34]. Because only a small fraction of \\u03b3-secretase complexes are catalytically active [35], it was hypothesized that other co-factors could stimulate the inactive pool of \\u03b3-secretase. Discoveries of \\u03b3-secretase modulatory proteins (GSMPs), non-essential subunits which can bind to and modulate \\u03b3-secretase in response to cellular and environmental changes, have added an interesting layer of regulation [33, 34]. Multiple studies have identified GSMPs which regulate \\u03b3-secretase activity and substrate specificity and are dependent on specific contexts: GSAP by aging [36, 37], IFITM3 by innate immunity and aging [38], Hif-1\\u03b1 by hypoxia [39], and SERP1 by ER stress [40]. GSMPs therefore have become implicated in the development of therapeutics for AD.

    "\n",
    "The working hypothesis posits that targeting gamma secretase (GSEC) can effectively modulate the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ42, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By selectively inhibiting GSEC activity, it may be possible to reduce the accumulation of neurotoxic Aβ aggregates, thus mitigating the progression of AD. This approach is grounded in the understanding that GSEC is responsible for the final cleavage of APP, leading to the generation of Aβ peptides of varying lengths, with Aβ42 being particularly pathogenic.\n",

Targeting GSEC represents a novel strategy to directly influence the production of Aβ, thus addressing a key pathological feature of AD.\n",

    "### Working Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The gamma-secretase (GSEC) complex is crucial in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its role in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). GSEC cleaves APP to produce amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, notably Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are integral to the formation of amyloid plaques, a defining characteristic of AD. The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to initiate neurotoxic cascades that lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. This underscores the importance of GSEC as a therapeutic target in AD, with the goal of modulating its activity to decrease the production of pathogenic Aβ species.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unmet medical need in AD treatment arises from the failure of previous therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ, particularly gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which caused severe side effects due to the inhibition of Notch signaling and other essential pathways. This highlights the necessity for more selective approaches, such as gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) or allosteric stabilizers, which could alter Aβ processing without compromising GSEC's other physiological functions. The failure of GSIs has prompted a shift towards understanding the complex biology of GSEC and its substrates to develop safer and more effective therapeutics.\n",
    "\n",
    "GSEC represents a suitable candidate for combination therapy, particularly when paired with other approaches targeting different aspects of AD pathology, such as tau aggregation or neuroinflammation. By modulating GSEC activity in conjunction with other therapeutic modalities, it may be possible to achieve a more comprehensive treatment strategy that addresses multiple facets of AD progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive biomarkers for AD, such as the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40, have been shown to correlate with disease progression and can serve as valuable indicators for therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials. Existing biomarkers, including amyloid PET imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, provide critical insights into the amyloid burden in patients and can facilitate patient stratification for clinical studies. The identification of patients with elevated levels of Aβ42 or those exhibiting specific genetic mutations linked to familial AD can enhance the precision of therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC and its role in Aβ production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, no cure exists for Alzheimer's disease, and existing treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. With the aging population, the prevalence of AD continues to rise, creating an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC offers a promising opportunity to alter the course of AD by reducing levels of neurotoxic Aβ peptides, potentially preventing or delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in at-risk populations. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43 is especially linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), highlighting the critical need for effective GSEC modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease, therapies targeting GSEC could be effectively combined with other treatment modalities. For example, combining GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may provide a synergistic effect, addressing both amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD. Such combination therapies could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes, particularly considering the complex interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation observed in AD pathology. The translational value of these combination strategies is further supported by studies indicating that GSEC inhibition can lead to altered Aβ peptide profiles without exacerbating the production of toxic fragments like C99.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of predictive biomarkers for AD is essential for identifying individuals at risk and monitoring disease progression. Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, as an increased ratio indicates the amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlates with amyloid plaque deposition. Neurofilament light protein is also emerging as a biomarker of neurodegeneration, reflecting its translational value in both animal models and clinical settings. These biomarkers can guide clinical decision-making and the selection of appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing biomarkers, including neuroimaging techniques (such as PET scans detecting amyloid deposition) and CSF analysis for Aβ peptides, hold significant clinical relevance. They assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and help identify patients who may benefit from GSEC-targeted therapies. The use of these biomarkers in clinical trials can also aid in stratifying patients based on their likelihood of responding to GSEC modulators, thereby optimizing trial outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches in AD treatment. The correlation between CSF Aβ levels and brain deposition further emphasizes the role of these biomarkers in understanding GSEC activity and its implications for AD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSF Aβ42 levels:** Reduced levels of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could indicate effective inhibition of gamma secretase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amyloid PET imaging:** Decreased amyloid plaque burden on positron emission tomography (PET) scans could serve as a marker of treatment response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio:** Changes in the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 in the blood could reflect alterations in amyloid processing and serve as a non-invasive biomarker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing biomarkers for AD, such as CSF Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau levels, as well as amyloid PET imaging, are clinically relevant for diagnosing AD and assessing disease progression. These biomarkers can also be utilized to monitor the therapeutic effects of gamma secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, providing valuable information on their efficacy and mechanism of action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, targeting gamma secretase to reduce Aβ42 production represents a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Considering the unmet medical need for disease-modifying treatments, the suitability for combination therapy, and the availability of predictive and clinically relevant biomarkers, gamma secretase inhibitors have the potential to significantly impact the management of AD.\n",

    "### Working Hypothesis COT\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis posits that modulation of gamma secretase (GSEC) activity can effectively alter the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly reducing the generation of pathogenic forms like Aβ42 and Aβ43, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By targeting GSEC, it may be possible to decrease the accumulation of amyloid plaques, thereby mitigating neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD.\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are limited therapeutic options available for Alzheimer's disease that effectively target the underlying pathology. Most existing treatments focus on symptomatic relief rather than modifying disease progression. The accumulation of Aβ plaques is a hallmark of AD, and therapies aimed at reducing Aβ production or promoting its clearance are crucial. There is a pressing need for disease-modifying therapies that can address the root causes of AD, particularly those that can safely modulate GSEC activity without significant side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma secretase inhibitors or modulators could be effectively combined with other therapeutic strategies, such as anti-amyloid antibodies or tau-targeting agents. Combination therapy could enhance overall efficacy by addressing multiple pathological features of AD simultaneously. For instance, while GSEC modulation reduces Aβ production, concurrent use of tau-targeting therapies could prevent tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, providing a more comprehensive approach to disease management.\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential predictive biomarkers for GSEC-targeted therapies could include levels of specific Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), particularly Aβ42 and Aβ43. Monitoring changes in these biomarkers could provide insights into the efficacy of GSEC modulation. Additionally, biomarkers related to neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration, such as neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), may further inform treatment response and disease progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing biomarkers, such as Aβ and tau levels in CSF and amyloid PET imaging, are clinically relevant as they correlate with disease severity and progression. Elevated levels of Aβ42, alongside decreased levels of Aβ40, are indicative of amyloid pathology, while tau biomarkers are associated with neurodegeneration. The integration of these biomarkers into clinical trials for GSEC-targeted therapies could enhance patient stratification and efficacy assessment, ultimately facilitating the development of personalized treatment approaches in Alzheimer's disease."

The accumulation of these longer Aβ peptides in the brain is believed to trigger neurotoxic cascades, leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Therefore, GSEC emerges as a vital therapeutic target in AD, aiming to modulate its activity to diminish the production of harmful Aβ species.\n",

      "There exists an urgent medical need for effective Alzheimer’s treatments, as current therapies primarily offer symptomatic relief instead of addressing underlying mechanisms. The prevalence of AD is increasing with an aging population, highlighting the necessity for disease-modifying therapies. Targeting GSEC presents a promising strategy to change the disease trajectory by lowering neurotoxic Aβ levels, potentially preventing or delaying clinical symptoms in at-risk individuals. The production of Aβ42 and Aβ43 is especially linked to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), emphasizing the critical demand for effective GSEC modulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the multifactorial nature of AD suggests that GSEC-targeting therapies could be beneficial when used in combination with other modalities. For instance, pairing GSEC modulators with anti-inflammatory agents or therapies aimed at enhancing synaptic function may yield synergistic effects, addressing both amyloid pathology and the neuroinflammatory processes inherent in AD. These combination approaches could augment treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes by recognizing the intricate interplay between Aβ production and neuroinflammation.\n",

Biomarkers such as elevated levels of Aβ42 and Aβ43 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are correlated with the onset of AD. Additionally, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio serves as a potential predictive biomarker, with an increased ratio indicating amyloidogenic processing of APP and correlating with amyloid plaque deposition. Neurofilament light protein is also gaining recognition as a biomarker of neurodegeneration, demonstrating its translational value in both animal models and clinical contexts. These biomarkers play a critical role in guiding clinical decision-making and selecting appropriate therapeutic interventions targeting GSEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, including neuroimaging techniques like PET scans that detect amyloid deposition, and CSF analyses for Aβ peptides, are clinically relevant for early AD diagnosis and for identifying patients who may benefit from GSEC-targeted therapies.

The correlation between CSF Aβ levels and brain deposition further underscores the significance of these biomarkers in comprehending GSEC activity and its implications for AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, targeting gamma-secretase to reduce Aβ42 production signifies a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer’s disease. Given the critical unmet medical need for disease-modifying treatments, the potential for combination therapies, and the availability of both predictive and clinically relevant biomarkers, GSEC inhibitors could substantially influence the management and treatment outcomes for AD.\n"

Increased levels of Aβ42 may induce feedback inhibition on γ-secretase, leading to neuronal death through mechanisms involving p75 neurotrophin receptor activation, suggesting potential intervention pathways to mitigate these effects.\n",
