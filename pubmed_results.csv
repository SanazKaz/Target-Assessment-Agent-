Oligomeric HIV-1 Integrase Structures Reveal Functional Plasticity for Intasome Assembly and RNA Binding.,"Integrase (IN) performs dual essential roles during HIV-1 replication. During ingress, IN functions within an oligomeric ""intasome"" assembly to catalyze viral DNA integration into host chromatin. During late stages of infection, tetrameric IN binds viral RNA and orchestrates the condensation of ribonucleoprotein complexes into the capsid core. The molecular architectures of HIV-1 IN assemblies that mediate these distinct events remain unknown. Furthermore, the tetramer is an important antiviral target for allosteric IN inhibitors. Here, we determined cryo-EM structures of wildtype HIV-1 IN tetramers and intasome hexadecamers. Our structures unveil a remarkable plasticity that leverages IN C-terminal domains and abutting linkers to assemble functionally distinct oligomeric forms. Alteration of a newly recognized conserved interface revealed that both IN functions track with tetramerization <i>in vitro</i> and during HIV-1 infection. Collectively, our findings reveal how IN plasticity orchestrates its diverse molecular functions, suggest a working model for IN-viral RNA binding, and provide atomic blueprints for allosteric IN inhibitor development.","Jing T, Shan Z, Dinh T, Biswas A, Jang S, Greenwood J, Li M, Zhang Z, Gray G, Shin HJ, Zhou B, Passos D, Aiyer S, Li Z, Craigie R, Engelman AN, Kvaratskhelia M, Lyumkis D",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2024
Elucidating the Molecular Determinants of the Binding Modes of a Third-Generation HIV-1 Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor: The Importance of Side Chain and Solvent Reorganization.,"The first- and second-generation clinically used HIV-1 integrase (IN) strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are key components of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which work by blocking the integration step in the HIV-1 replication cycle that is catalyzed by a nucleoprotein assembly called an intasome. However, resistance to even the latest clinically used INSTIs is beginning to emerge. Developmental third-generation INSTIs, based on naphthyridine scaffolds, are promising candidates to combat drug-resistant viral variants. Among these novel INSTIs, compound <b>4f</b> exhibits two distinct conformations when binding with intasomes from HIV-1 and the closely related prototype foamy virus (PFV) despite the high structural similarity of their INSTI binding pockets. The molecular mechanism and the key active site residues responsible for these differing binding modes in closely related intasomes remain elusive. To unravel the molecular determinants governing the two distinct binding modes, we applied a novel molecular dynamics-based free energy method that utilizes alchemical pathways to overcome the sampling challenges associated with transitioning between the two bound conformations of ligand <b>4f</b> within the crowded environments of the INSTI binding pockets in these intasomes. The calculated conformational free energies successfully recapitulate the experimentally observed binding mode preferences in the two viral intasomes. Analysis of the simulated structures suggests that the observed binding mode preferences are caused by amino acid residue differences in both the front and the central catalytic sub-pocket of the INSTI binding site in HIV-1 and PFV. Additional free energy calculations on mutants of HIV-1 and PFV revealed that while both sub-pockets contribute to binding mode selection, the central sub-pocket plays a more important role. These results highlight the importance of both side chain and solvent reorganization, as well as the conformational entropy in determining the ligand binding mode, and will help inform the development of more effective INSTIs for combatting drug-resistant viral variants.","Sun Q, Biswas A, Lyumkis D, Levy R, Deng N",Viruses,2024

Mechanisms of HIV-1 integrase resistance to dolutegravir and potent inhibition of drug-resistant variants.,"HIV-1 infection depends on the integration of viral DNA into host chromatin. Integration is mediated by the viral enzyme integrase and is blocked by integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), first-line antiretroviral therapeutics widely used in the clinic. Resistance to even the best INSTIs is a problem, and the mechanisms of resistance are poorly understood. Here, we analyze combinations of the mutations E138K, G140A/S, and Q148H/K/R, which confer resistance to INSTIs. The investigational drug 4d more effectively inhibited the mutants compared with the approved drug Dolutegravir (DTG). We present 11 new cryo-EM structures of drug-resistant HIV-1 intasomes bound to DTG or 4d, with better than 3-Å resolution. These structures, complemented with free energy simulations, virology, and enzymology, explain the mechanisms of DTG resistance involving E138K + G140A/S + Q148H/K/R and show why 4d maintains potency better than DTG. These data establish a foundation for further development of INSTIs that potently inhibit resistant forms in integrase.","Li M, Oliveira Passos D, Shan Z, Smith SJ, Sun Q, Biswas A, Choudhuri I, Strutzenberg TS, Haldane A, Deng N, Li Z, Zhao XZ, Briganti L, Kvaratskhelia M, Burke TR, Levy RM, Hughes SH, Craigie R, Lyumkis D",Science advances,2023
Modulation of the functional interfaces between retroviral intasomes and the human nucleosome.,"Infection by retroviruses as HIV-1 requires the stable integration of their genome into the host cells. This process needs the formation of integrase (IN)-viral DNA complexes, called intasomes, and their interaction with the target DNA wrapped around nucleosomes within cell chromatin. To provide new tools to analyze this association and select drugs, we applied the AlphaLISA technology to the complex formed between the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome and nucleosome reconstituted on 601 Widom sequence. This system allowed us to monitor the association between both partners and select small molecules that could modulate the intasome/nucleosome association. Using this approach, drugs acting either on the DNA topology within the nucleosome or on the IN/histone tail interactions have been selected. Within these compounds, doxorubicin and histone binders calixarenes were characterized using biochemical, <i>in silico</i> molecular simulations and cellular approaches. These drugs were shown to inhibit both PFV and HIV-1 integration <i>in vitro</i>. Treatment of HIV-1-infected PBMCs with the selected molecules induces a decrease in viral infectivity and blocks the integration process. Thus, in addition to providing new information about intasome-nucleosome interaction determinants, our work also paves the way for further unedited antiviral strategies that target the final step of intasome/chromatin anchoring. IMPORTANCE In this work, we report the first monitoring of retroviral intasome/nucleosome interaction by AlphaLISA. This is the first description of the AlphaLISA application for large nucleoprotein complexes (>200 kDa) proving that this technology is suitable for molecular characterization and bimolecular inhibitor screening assays using such large complexes. Using this system, we have identified new drugs disrupting or preventing the intasome/nucleosome complex and inhibiting HIV-1 integration both <i>in vitro</i> and in infected cells. This first monitoring of the retroviral/intasome complex should allow the development of multiple applications including the analyses of the influence of cellular partners, the study of additional retroviral intasomes, and the determination of specific interfaces. Our work also provides the technical bases for the screening of larger libraries of drugs targeting specifically these functional nucleoprotein complexes, or additional nucleosome-partner complexes, as well as for their characterization.","Mauro E, Lapaillerie D, Tumiotto C, Charlier C, Martins F, Sousa SF, Métifiot M, Weigel P, Yamatsugu K, Kanai M, Munier-Lehmann H, Richetta C, Maisch M, Dutrieux J, Batisse J, Ruff M, Delelis O, Lesbats P, Parissi V",mBio,2023
Molecular determinants for Rous sarcoma virus intasome assemblies involved in retroviral integration.,"Integration of retroviral DNA into the host genome involves the formation of integrase (IN)-DNA complexes termed intasomes. Further characterization of these complexes is needed to understand their assembly process. Here, we report the single-particle cryo-EM structure of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) strand transfer complex (STC) intasome produced with IN and a preassembled viral/target DNA substrate at 3.36 Å resolution. The conserved intasome core region consisting of IN subunits contributing active sites interacting with viral/target DNA has a resolution of 3 Å. Our structure demonstrated the flexibility of the distal IN subunits relative to the IN subunits in the conserved intasome core, similar to results previously shown with the RSV octameric cleaved synaptic complex intasome produced with IN and viral DNA only. An extensive analysis of higher resolution STC structure helped in the identification of nucleoprotein interactions important for intasome assembly. Using structure-function studies, we determined the mechanisms of several IN-DNA interactions critical for assembly of both RSV intasomes. We determined the role of IN residues R244, Y246, and S124 in cleaved synaptic complex and STC intasome assemblies and their catalytic activities, demonstrating differential effects. Taken together, these studies advance our understanding of different RSV intasome structures and molecular determinants involved in their assembly.","Bera S, Shi K, Aihara H, Grandgenett DP, Pandey KK",The Journal of biological chemistry,2023
Emergence of Resistance in HIV-1 Integrase with Dolutegravir Treatment in a Pediatric Population from the IMPAACT P1093 Study.,"P1093 is a multicenter, open-label, phase I/II study of pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of dolutegravir plus an optimized background regimen in pediatric participants aged 4 weeks to <18 years with HIV-1. Most participants were highly treatment experienced. We report the mechanisms of emergent integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance among adolescents and children receiving dolutegravir. Plasma was collected at screening and near protocol-defined virologic failure (PDVF) for population-level and, for some samples, clonal-level integrase genotyping, phenotyping, and replication capacity. HIV-1 RNA was assessed in all available plasma samples. Phylogenetic analysis of clonal integrase sequences and homology modeling of HIV-1 intasome complexes containing resistance-associated substitutions were performed. Treatment-emergent INSTI resistance was detected in 8 participants who met PDVF criteria. The rare INSTI resistance-associated substitution G118R or R263K developed in 6 participants. The on-study secondary integrase substitution E157Q or L74I was observed in 2 participants. G118R reduced dolutegravir susceptibility and integrase replication capacity more than R263K and demonstrated greater reduction in susceptibility and integrase replication capacity when present with specific secondary integrase substitutions, including L74M, T66I, and E138E/K. Continuing evolution after R263K acquisition led to reduced dolutegravir susceptibility and integrase replication capacity. Structural examination revealed potential mechanisms for G118R- and R263K-mediated INSTI resistance. G118R and R263K INSTI resistance substitutions, which are distinct to second-generation INSTIs, were detected in adolescents and children with prior virologic failure who received dolutegravir. This study provides additional molecular and structural characterization of integrase to aid in the understanding of INSTI resistance mechanisms in antiretroviral-experienced populations.

Structural basis for the inhibition of HTLV-1 integration inferred from cryo-EM deltaretroviral intasome structures.,"Between 10 and 20 million people worldwide are infected with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Despite causing life-threatening pathologies there is no therapeutic regimen for this deltaretrovirus. Here, we screened a library of integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) candidates built around several chemical scaffolds to determine their effectiveness in limiting HTLV-1 infection. Naphthyridines with substituents in position 6 emerged as the most potent compounds against HTLV-1, with XZ450 having highest efficacy in vitro. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy we visualised XZ450 as well as the clinical HIV-1 INSTIs raltegravir and bictegravir bound to the active site of the deltaretroviral intasome. The structures reveal subtle differences in the coordination environment of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion pair involved in the interaction with the INSTIs. Our results elucidate the binding of INSTIs to the HTLV-1 intasome and support their use for pre-exposure prophylaxis and possibly future treatment of HTLV-1 infection.","Barski MS, Vanzo T, Zhao XZ, Smith SJ, Ballandras-Colas A, Cronin NB, Pye VE, Hughes SH, Burke TR, Cherepanov P, Maertens GN",Nature communications,2021
Structure and function of retroviral integrase.,"A hallmark of retroviral replication is establishment of the proviral state, wherein a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome is stably incorporated into a host cell chromosome. Integrase is the viral enzyme responsible for the catalytic steps involved in this process, and integrase strand transfer inhibitors are widely used to treat people living with HIV. Over the past decade, a series of X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy studies have revealed the structural basis of retroviral DNA integration. A variable number of integrase molecules congregate on viral DNA ends to assemble a conserved intasome core machine that facilitates integration. The structures additionally informed on the modes of integrase inhibitor action and the means by which HIV acquires drug resistance. Recent years have witnessed the development of allosteric integrase inhibitors, a highly promising class of small molecules that antagonize viral morphogenesis. In this Review, we explore recent insights into the organization and mechanism of the retroviral integration machinery and highlight open questions as well as new directions in the field.","Maertens GN, Engelman AN, Cherepanov P",Nature reviews.

Cryo-EM structure of the Rous sarcoma virus octameric cleaved synaptic complex intasome.,"Despite conserved catalytic integration mechanisms, retroviral intasomes composed of integrase (IN) and viral DNA possess diverse structures with variable numbers of IN subunits. To investigate intasome assembly mechanisms, we employed the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) IN dimer that assembles a precursor tetrameric structure in transit to the mature octameric intasome. We determined the structure of RSV octameric intasome stabilized by a HIV-1 IN strand transfer inhibitor using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structure revealed significant flexibility of the two non-catalytic distal IN dimers along with previously unrecognized movement of the conserved intasome core, suggesting ordered conformational transitions between intermediates that may be important to capture the target DNA. Single amino acid substitutions within the IN C-terminal domain affected intasome assembly and function in vitro and infectivity of pseudotyped RSV virions. Unexpectedly, 17 C-terminal amino acids of IN were dispensable for virus infection despite regulating the transition of the tetrameric intasome to the octameric form in vitro. We speculate that this region may regulate the binding of highly flexible distal IN dimers to the intasome core to form the octameric complex. Our studies reveal key steps in the assembly of RSV intasomes.","Pandey KK, Bera S, Shi K, Rau MJ, Oleru AV, Fitzpatrick JAJ, Engelman AN, Aihara H, Grandgenett DP",Communications biology,2021
